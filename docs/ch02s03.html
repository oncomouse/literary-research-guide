                  but with some publications as late as 1989) important to the study of the English
                  language and literatures in English. Entries are organized in 24 variously
                  classified divisions for general reference works; libraries; retrospective and
                  current national bibliographies; guides to serial publications; miscellaneous
                  topics (including dissertations, microforms, reviews, indexes to anonymous and
                  pseudonymous works, and films); historical sources; biography and biographical
                  references; archives and manuscripts; language, linguistics, and philology;
                  literary materials and contexts (including folklore, mythology, the Bible,
                  proverbs, quotations, and symbols); literature (a miscellany including sections
                  for literary dictionaries, various foreign literatures, children’s literature, and
                  women and literature); English literature (with sections for general works as well
                  as various new literatures in English); medieval literature; Renaissance and early
                  seventeenth century; Restoration and eighteenth century; nineteenth century;
                  twentieth century; American literature; poetry and versification; theater, drama,
                  and film; prose and prose fiction; literary theory and criticism, rhetoric, and
                  composition; bibliography; and the profession of English (including sections on
                  research guides, scholarly writing and publishing, computers, and careers). Within
                  a typical section, guides and reviews of research appear first, then
                  bibliographies, and then other reference works; many sections also include
                  unannotated lists of journals and frequently recommended studies. Reference
                  sources are fully annotated, usually with descriptions of a work’s history,
                  purpose, scope, and organization; comments on uses; a judicious evaluation; and
                  references to related works, many of which are not entered separately. Three
                  indexes: persons; titles; subjects (with works appearing in the lists of
                  recommended studies indexed in only the last). Given the principles determining
                  placement of a work and the sometimes confusing organization, the subject index
                  offers the best access to contents. Thorough in its annotations, usually judicious
                  in selection and evaluation, and covering some non-English language works,
                     <em class="citetitle">Reference Guide for English Studies</em> is a valuable
                  complement to the present <em class="citetitle">Literary Research Guide</em> and a
                  trustworthy companion for the novice as well as for the advanced scholar. Users
                  must remember that Marcuse is current only through 1985 and thus cites many
                  superseded editions or works and describes editorial policies or taxonomies that
                  are now quite different.</p><p class="annotation">For a comparison of the first edition of this
