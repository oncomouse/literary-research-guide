                  Christian era (c. 337), with entries for authors and other important persons,
                  places, peoples, mythological figures, themes, deities, languages, forms, genres,
                  historical events, and literary terms; literary works of known authorship are
                  discussed in author entries. Beginning with the third edition,
                     <em class="citetitle">OCD</em> emphasizes interdisciplinary studies over
                  literature, increases its attention to women, and embraces a wider, more
                  international vision of classical studies. The more than 6,300 signed entries by
                  established scholars range from a few lines to several pages, but even the brief
                  ones are replete with information. Almost all conclude with references to
                  important scholarship. The InteLex electronic versions (static texts with
                  hyperlinks) can be browsed by entry or searched by keyword. Because the Folio
                  search interface on the CD-ROM is cumbersome to use, researchers should opt, if
                  possible, for the online version, which has a better search screen. See entry

                  Authoritative and informative, the work is the best single-volume classical
                  dictionary in English and an essential desktop reference for deciphering classical
                  allusions in literary works; it truly has, as its editors claim, “no competitor in
                  any language.”</p><p class="annotation">Although less authoritative and offering briefer discussions,

                  arts, music, dance, and literature of the Western world. In addition to
                  mythological figures and themes “that have inspired an appreciable number of
                  artistic treatments,” the <em class="citetitle">Guide</em> includes some subjects that
                  derive from classical myths and some stories based on classical literature; it

                  Aphrodite and Odysseus, are thematically subdivided) begin with a headnote that
                  briefly describes the subject and lists major classical sources and, occasionally,
                  scholarly books on the subject; the note is followed by a chronological list
                  (usually organized by date of composition) of works in which the subject is
                  central or prominent or that contain an especially famous or seminal brief
                  treatment of the subject. (The chronological order is, however, violated when
                  works by the same artist are grouped under the date of the earliest work.) For
                  each work, provides—as appropriate—author; title; explanation of the work’s
                  relation to the subject; genre or medium; date of composition (or first
                  publication, exhibition, or performance); publication or performance details;
                  present location; and citations to other versions, translations, copies, or
                  revisions related to the original. Indexed by artists. The breadth of coverage,
                  the wealth of information, the careful attention to significant details, and the
                  clear organization make the <em class="citetitle">Guide</em> an impressive achievement
                  that will both stimulate and make feasible a variety of studies—interdisciplinary,
