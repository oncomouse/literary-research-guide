                     American, and some other literatures in English. Coverage of American
                     literature began in vol. 35 (for 1954); a chapter on African, Caribbean, and
                     Canadian literature in English was added in vol. 63 (for 1982) and expanded to
                     include Australian, New Zealand, and Indian literature in vol. 64 (for 1983)
                     and South Pacific literature in vol. 81 (2000). In vol. 85 (for 2004) Indian
                     literature was expanded to the Indian subcontinent and Sri Lanka. Each volume
                     is organized by individual essays devoted to periods, national literatures,
                     major authors (Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton [Milton and poetry, 1603–1680 or
                     1603–1660 since vol. 80 (for 1999)]), the English language, and bibliography
                     and textual criticism. Some volumes include chapters on reference works,
                     literary history, and literary theory (with coverage of the last now relegated
                     to <em class="citetitle">Year’s Work in Critical and Cultural Theory</em> [<a class="link" href="ch21s21.xhtml#U6133" title="U6133">U6133</a>]). The scope of some chapters
                     varies over the years.</p><p class="annotation">Coverage is necessarily selective (sometimes erratic,
                     idiosyncratic, or restricted because of the unavailability of works) and
                     emphasizes Anglo-American scholarship. The quality, objectivity, rigor of
                     evaluation, and breadth of individual chapters vary, depending on the
                     contributor(s), but most attempt to evaluate judiciously the most significant
                     scholarship. To offer representative coverage of the steadily increasing number
                     of studies, contributors in recent volumes tend to be more succinct in
                     discussing an individual work. Citations to books and articles do not include
                     complete bibliographical information until vol. 68 (for 1987). A volume now
                     appears about a year after the year of scholarship it covers; the classified
                     list of books received for future review lasted only from vol. 64 (for 1983)
                     through vol. 73 (for 1992). The online version, which includes all volumes,
                     publishes chapters as they are edited and typeset. Two indexes: critics;
                     subjects and literary authors. Since vol. 47 (for 1966) the subject indexing
                     has been more detailed and includes titles of literary works.</p><p class="annotation">Chapters have been reproduced in three collections

                     books and articles are identified in a separate list. Together, the annual
                     volumes offer an incomparable record of scholarly and critical trends as well
                     as of the fluctuations of academic reputations of literary works and

                     requires close familiarity with the many alterations over the years in

                     instituted with the 1981 <em class="citetitle">Bibliography</em> and the general
                     similarity of the organization of the earlier volumes, a separate consideration
                     of the two periods is appropriate.</p><p class="annotation">
                     <em class="citetitle">MLAIB for 1921–80</em>. Originally titled the “American
                     Bibliography,” published in essay format, nominally limited to scholarship by
                     Americans, and covering English, Romance, Germanic, and American languages and
                     literatures, the bibliography gradually expanded its scope to cover other
                     literatures and languages, and to become “international” in the volume for
                     1956. Volumes covering 1921–68 were published as a part of
                        <em class="citetitle">PMLA</em>; however, many libraries will have these volumes
                     in the separate reprints published by Kraus or New York University Press. With
                     the 1969 volume the <em class="citetitle">Bibliography</em> became a separate
                     publication issued in four parts (each with its separate index of scholars).
                     Pt. 1: General, English, American, Medieval and Neo-Latin, and Celtic
                     Literatures; pt. 2: General Romance, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and
                     Brazilian, Romanian, General Germanic, German, Netherlandic, Scandinavian,
                     Modern Greek, Asian, African, and East European Literatures; pt. 3:
                     Linguistics; pt. 4: ACTFL Annual Bibliography on Pedagogy in Foreign Languages.
                     (Most libraries will have the bound library edition.) In the 1970 volume,
                     Folklore became a separate section in pt. 1; pt. 4 was discontinued after the
                     1972 <em class="citetitle">MLAIB</em>.</p><p class="annotation">The continual expansion was accompanied by numerous
                     changes in the organization of sections and refinements in the classification
                     of entries (especially in the bibliographies for 1926, 1928, 1953, 1956, 1957,
                     1967, and 1969); consequently, users must be certain to check the table of
                     contents at the beginning of each volume. In general, scholarship on literary
                     works is organized by national literature, then (after a general section) by
                     period, and then by genre and literary author; some literatures, however, are
                     grouped by language rather than geography (e.g., Cornish and Welsh are under
                     Celtic Literatures; French-Canadian and West Indian are listed with French
                     Literature). Studies not assignable to a national literature, general
                     discussions of themes or genres, and works about criticism and theory are
                     listed in the General Literature section (which for many years also served as a
                     catchall and included several national literatures, folklore, and general
                     linguistics). Folklore scholarship is classified by broad topics (e.g., Folk
                     Poetry, Folk Games and Toys, Material Culture), then by types (e.g., Folk
                     Poetry includes headings for Oral Epics, Ballads, Songs, and Rhymes and
                     Verses), and then continent. (Folklore scholarship appears in the various
                     national literature divisions through the volume for 1927 and in the General
                     division in the volumes for 1928–68; even after Folklore became a separate
                     division, several national literatures continued to include a Folklore
                     section.) The Linguistics part includes classified sections for linguistic
                     topics (e.g., Theoretical and Descriptive Linguistics includes a subdivision
                     for Grammar, which is further subdivided into General and Miscellaneous,
                     Morphophonemics, Morphology, Syntax, Word Classes and Categories, and Discourse
                     Analysis) and language groups (subdivided by specific languages, with further
                     subdivisions for General Studies, Bibliography, Dialectology, Graphemics,
                     Lexis, Morphology, Onomastics, Phonology, Semantics, Stylistics, Syntax, and
                     Translation). Until the volume for 1967 (which marks the beginning of
                     systematic coverage of linguistic studies), linguistic scholarship was included
                     with individual languages; general linguistic studies were listed in the
                     General section.</p><p class="annotation">A publication is listed only once in each part, with up to
                     five cross-references; any work that requires more is relegated, without
                     cross-references, to the most appropriate general heading (e.g., a book on
                     several English plays, medieval through modern, would usually be listed only
                     under Drama in the General section of the English Literature division; an
                     article surveying plays from several national literatures would usually appear
                     only under Drama in the General IV: Themes and Types section). Thus scholars
                     must be certain to search appropriate general sections.</p><p class="annotation">Most journals and series are cited by acronyms keyed to
                     the Master List of Periodicals found at the front of each part. (Serials on the
                     Master List are fully described in <em class="citetitle">MLA Directory of
                        Periodicals</em> [<a class="link" href="ch11s02.xhtml#K615" title="K615">K615</a>].) Essays from a collection or Festschrift (identifiable by a
                     bracketed number preceded by F) are keyed to the Festschriften and Other
                     Analyzed Collections entries at the beginning of each part. In the volumes for
                     1970–75, an asterisk preceding an entry number means that an abstract is
                     printed in the corresponding volume of <em class="citetitle">MLA Abstracts of Articles in
                        Scholarly Journals</em> (New York: MLA, 1972–77, annual); these
                     abstracts have been added to the <em class="citetitle">MLAIB</em> database. Indexed
                     by scholars’ names in most volumes since 1948.</p><p class="annotation">
                     <em class="citetitle">MLAIB for 1981–2008</em>. Since the introduction of a
                     sophisticated computerized classification and indexing system in the volume for
                     1981, the <em class="citetitle">Bibliography</em> has been published in five parts
                     (with variations in some titles). Pt. 1: British and Irish, Breton,
                     Commonwealth, English Caribbean, and American Literatures; pt. 2: European,
                     Asian, African, and Latin American Literatures; pt. 3: Linguistics; pt. 4:
                     General Literature, Humanities, Teaching of Literature, and Rhetoric and
                     Composition; pt. 5: Folklore. Most libraries will subscribe to the library
                     edition, which includes all five parts and comprehensive scholar and subject
                     indexes. National literature sections are classified chronologically in pts. 1
                     and 2; depending on the scholarship covered in a volume, chronological spans
                     range from a single century to several centuries. For example, a book on
                     English drama from the Renaissance to the modern period would appear in a
                     division headed “English Literature/1500–1999”; an article on Black Mountain
                     poets would appear in “American Literature/1900–1999.” Chronological divisions
                     encompassing more than a century include subdivisions for general studies and
                     genres; those limited to a century or, for some literatures, a broader early
                     period (e.g., Old English, medieval, Old Russian, Ch’ing Dynasty period) are
                     further classified by literary author. Individual authors have subdivisions for
                     general studies, bibliographies, genres, and literary works. In general, the
                     post-1980 volumes are more consistent than their predecessors in distinguishing
                     national literatures. The remaining inconsistencies—for example, there are no
                     separate sections for Swiss or Austrian literature—are generally ameliorated by
                     the national literature headings in the subject index.</p><p class="annotation">Studies on general literature and related topics are
                     currently classified in pt. 4 under fifteen broad divisions: General
                     Literature, Comparative Literature, Humanities, Research Tools,
                     Bibliographical, Censorship, Dramatic Arts, Figures of Speech, Genres, Literary
                     Forms, Literary Movements, Literary Theory and Criticism, Themes and Figures,
                     Teaching of Literature, Rhetoric and Composition. Each includes appropriate
                     subdivisions, again depending on the nature of the scholarship covered in a
                     given volume (e.g., the Poetry subdivision of the Genres division might include
                     headings for Concrete Poetry, Elegy, Haiku, Lyric Poetry, and Prose
                     Poem).</p><p class="annotation">Linguistic scholarship is organized by broad topics
                     (Linguistics, History of Linguistics, Theory of Linguistics, Applied
                     Linguistics, Areal Linguistics, Comparative Linguistics, Diachronic
                     Linguistics, Language Interaction, Mathematical Linguistics, Paralinguistics,
                     Psycholinguistics, Sociolinguistics, Teaching of Linguistics), by aspects of
                     language (Dialectology, Grammar, Lexicology, Morphology, Morphophonology,
                     Onomastics, Phonetics, Phonology, Pragmatics, Prosody, Semantics, Stylistics,
                     Syntax, Translation, Writing Systems), and by specific language. Each section
                     includes appropriate divisions and subdivisions (e.g., Sociolinguistics has
                     subdivisions for Ethnolinguistics, Language Attitudes, Language Policy, Social
                     Dialects, and Speech Registers; Stylistics has a subdivision for Rhetoric).
                     Folklore studies are listed in pt. 5 under general studies and under headings
                     for History and Study of Folklore, Folk Literature, Ethnomusicology, Folk
                     Belief Systems, Folk Rituals, and Material Culture. Each is subdivided by type
                     or genre and then by geographic area (continent, region, country); for example,
                     Folk Literature has subdivisions for Folk Speech Play, Folk Narrative, and Folk
                     Poetry (the last with headings for such forms as ballad, epic, and folk
                     song).</p><p class="annotation">A study is listed only once in each part; there are no
                     cross-references in the classified listings, since the subject index provides
                     access to related authors, genres, or subjects. Acronyms are still used for
                     most journal and series titles, but an entry for an essay from a collection
                     provides full bibliographical information (and thus does away with the [F]
                     numbers that mystified so many users of the pre-1981 bibliography). Since index
                     terms are printed within brackets following a citation, researchers can usually
                     get some sense of the content of a study.</p><p class="annotation">Of most benefit is the subject indexing made possible by
                     the new system. Each separately published part or combination thereof includes
                     self-contained subject and scholar indexes, but for comprehensive searches
                     users must consult the integrated indexes to the library edition. All searches
                     should begin with the subject index because the classified listings include no
                     cross-references. The subject index provides access to literary authors,
                     genres, groups, themes, literary movements, motifs, literary characters,
                     theories, critics, scholars, linguistic features, techniques (such as
                     characterization, allusion), languages, folklore genres, literary features
                     (e.g., structure, point of view), and processes (e.g., textual revision). In
                     addition, the subject index provides access to national literatures that do not
                     have their own sections in the classified listings as well as literatures that
                     do not fall within the primary language of a given country. For example,
                     literature in Spanish by American writers is found under the heading
                     Spanish-Language Literature; all medieval Latin references can be located as a
                     group in the subject index under Latin-Language Literature. Similar principles
                     apply to Yiddish-language literature, French-language literature (e.g., in
                     Africa), and English-language literature (e.g., in India and South Africa).
                     Each subject heading is followed by the citations in which it appears. Since
                     each citation prints its full list of subject terms, a user can frequently
                     judge the probable relevance of a book or article before looking it up in the
                     classified listing. Many subject headings also refer users to related
                     headings.</p><p class="annotation">

                     impediment to the use of the print volumes for 1921 through 1980. However, free
                     text searching of the database makes some subject access possible for entries
                     from 1926 on (e.g., searchers can retrieve all studies with “Joyce” and
                        “<em class="citetitle">Ulysses</em>” in their respective titles or that have
                     been classified under Irish Literature/1900–1999/Joyce, James).</p><p class="annotation">Online searching of post-1980 entries offers some
                     advantages (besides speed) over manual searches of the printed classified
                     listings and subject indexes. Using combinations of descriptors (e.g., codes
                     for genre, literary technique, theme, place, or time period), a researcher can
                     narrow a search to various levels (e.g., one could quickly isolate journal
                     articles written in English between 1982 and 1985 and employing an archetypal
                     approach to Joyce’s use of the journey motif in
                     <em class="citetitle">Ulysses</em>). Searching journal articles improved in 2008,
                     when <em class="citetitle">MLAIB</em> began including abstracts provided by some
                     publishers. Although some descriptors were added and classification
                     discrepancies resolved when listings from 1926 through 1980 were added to the
                     database, online searching of these entries will never allow the flexibility
                     and specificity possible with post-1980 citations. Those using the online file
                     should watch the MLA Web site for updates on search techniques or consult the
                     guides associated with the vendor interfaces.</p><p class="annotation">Despite the dramatic increase in accessibility to the
                     post-1980 listings, a search of the printed subject indexes or online file must
                     sometimes be supplemented by a reading of appropriate sections in the
                     classified volumes. Although the number of index terms has grown steadily each
                     year, many broad studies can be described in only the most general terms, and
                     some publications, lacking a thesis or any discernible focus, cannot be given
                     any descriptors. Subject indexing, at its best, is an imperfect art. A book or
                     essay usually requires an MLA bibliographer to choose among a range of indexing
                     possibilities, and no two people are likely to index any but the most
                     straightforward study in the same way.</p><p class="annotation">No reference work of this magnitude, especially one that
                     relies heavily in its earlier years on a network of volunteer contributors, is
                     without its limitations and faults. Before 1956 the
                        <em class="citetitle">Bibliography</em> was generally (but never completely, as
                     some descriptions erroneously assert) restricted to scholarship by American
                     authors. Although it became “international” in 1956 and includes books, essays
                     from edited collections, journal articles, review essays (but not reviews),
                     scholarly Web sites, and published abstracts of dissertations, coverage has
                     never been exhaustive. The classification system—sometimes maddeningly quirky
                     and inconsistent—requires considerable time to master. (For a discussion of
                     inconsistencies involving literatures in English, see Reed Way Dasenbrock,
                        ““<span class="citetitle">English Department Geography: Interpreting the

                     unwieldy classification scheme and are largely obviated by the subject index
                     and the wide electronic dissemination of the
                        <em class="citetitle">Bibliography</em>.) Until 1981 there is no convenient way
                     of determining what serials listed in the Master List of Periodicals are
                     actually covered in a given volume; in the bibliographies since that for 1989,
                     an asterisk preceding an acronym in the Master List denotes that at least one
                     issue of the journal or volume in the series is indexed (those with access to
                     the database can search by journal and year to determine which volumes were
                     actually covered); issues of journals whose coverage lapses for a year or more
                     are frequently left unanalyzed. New journals are not always added in a timely
                     manner; when they are, retrospective coverage is haphazard. For coverage of
                     single-author monographs, which is particularly weak, researchers should rely
                     instead on <em class="citetitle">WorldCat</em> (<a class="link" href="ch05s02.xhtml#E225" title="E225">E225</a>); for an analysis of one year’s coverage of

                     the coverage of) the content of single-author monographs has improved with the
                     introduction of a searchable table of contents field beginning with records
                     added in 2003. For suggestions about how the <em class="citetitle">MLAIB</em> can

                     Australian, African, Asian); recent volumes also cover selectively film, travel
                     writing, and cultural studies. Although a number of subdivisions have been
                     added, deleted, or combined over the years (especially in vols. 48 [for 1973],
                     51 [for 1976], and 60 [for 1985]), the scope and basic organization have
                     remained fairly stable (although coverage of unpublished dissertations was
                     discontinued with 75 [for 2000]). Entries are currently organized in divisions
                     for bibliography; scholarly method and resources (incorporating the division
                     formerly for language, literature, and the computer); newspapers and other
                     periodicals; English language; traditional culture, folklore, and folklife;
                     English literature; cinema, broadcasting, and interactive media (added in vol.
                     84 [for 2009]; in earlier volumes, these were subsections under the twentieth-
                     and twenty-first-century sections). The English literature division has
                     sections for general studies and periods (Old English, Middle English and
                     fifteenth century, then by century), with subsections for general studies,
                     genres, children’s literature, biography and autobiography, literary theory,
                     related studies, and individual authors. Entries are efficiently
                     cross-referenced, and uninformative titles are occasionally glossed. When
                     searching for reviews, users must remember that a book is relisted only in the
                     first section in which it originally appeared; e.g., a book on Shakespeare’s
                     language, originally classified in the Literary Stylistics and Poetics section,
                     would, in subsequent volumes, appear only in that section (without
                     cross-references and without inclusion in the subject index). Beginning with
                     vol. 66 (for 1991) the Sources and Abbreviations list includes only those
                     serials actually searched; an asterisk denotes a title from which an item was
                     indexed. Two indexes: authors and film directors; scholars. Coverage is
                     reasonably thorough (indeed, it improves markedly with vol. 66 [for 1991]); the
                     editors have embarked on a retrospective indexing program going back to 1991

                     keyword (that is, any word in the database), title keyword, subject, document

                     limited to the latest update, articles, books, and reviews. Records—which are
                     sorted by year (descending), then alphabetically by author (ascending)—can be
                     marked for e-mailing, downloading, or printing, and citations can be exported
                     into several kinds of bibliographic software; however, users should note that

                     alphabetically in descending order. Entries for reviews of a book are not
                     conflated; thus searchers must sometimes work through several entries to
                     identify all the reviews included. And, since it is not possible to limit a
                     search by accession number or update code, users must frequently read through

                     to the two serial bibliographies is difficult because of differences in scope,
                     level of indexing, and organization. Comparing the number of entries in similar
                     sections is an invalid measure, since <em class="citetitle">ABELL</em> numbers

                     distinguish among national literatures in literary period sections; comparing
                     the number of hits a search generates is equally invalid because of the greater
                     level of indexing in <em class="citetitle">MLAIB</em>. Before 1956—when
                        <em class="citetitle">MLAIB</em> was generally restricted to scholarship by
                     American authors—the duplication is frequently quite low. Although recent

                     focused on English- and French-language literatures, comparative literature,
                     and literary theory and history; before 1988 coverage extended to European as

                     divisions: general studies, sciences of literature (including literary theory,

                           locating studies that cite a pertinent book or article; (b) discussions
                           of literary authors buried in vaguely titled or broad studies. Because
                           indexers do not discriminate between passing references and substantial
                           discussions, users frequently will waste time tracking down insignificant
                           citations (especially in the case of a major, frequently cited author).
                           Also, the uncritical reliance on endnotes and footnotes results in
                           numerous misattributions and variant titles.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="list-item">The Corporate Index, which lists authors in the

                     periodicals (popular and academic) and monographic series published since 1665,
                     for the most part in North America and Western Europe. As of October 2012,
                     coverage encompasses more than 19 million records from more than 7,400 journals
                     published through the early 2000s (despite the site’s claim that 1995 is the
                     terminal date of coverage in <em class="citetitle">Index</em>). The full text of
                     articles in more than 1,200 journals (as of October 2012) can be searched
                     through <em class="citetitle">Periodicals Archive Online</em>. To discover what
                     issues of a journal are actually indexed, users must search by journal title or
                     browse the list on the Find Journals page, which also allows browsing the
                     contents of an issue. In both the <em class="citetitle">Index</em> and
                        <em class="citetitle">Archive</em>, Article Search allows records to be searched
                     by keyword (in the full text in <em class="citetitle">Archive</em>), title keyword,
                     author, language, journal title, subject of journal, ISSN, and date (and any
                     combination thereof); searchers can elect to exclude or search only book
                     reviews, articles indexed in <em class="citetitle">British Periodicals</em>,
                     citations linked to full text, and (in <em class="citetitle">Archive</em>)
                     unindexed front and back matter. The default search screen allows only a search
                     by article title, author, ISSN, journal title, or (in
                        <em class="citetitle">Archive</em>) full text. Search results can be sorted by
                     relevance, alphabetically by journal title, or date (ascending or descending);
                     in addition, results of a search can be filtered by journal title, language,
                     date ranges, or journal subjects. Records—which include basic bibliographical
                     information—can be marked for e-mailing, downloading, printing, or storing in a
                     personal archive. Indexing is based on tables of contents (which are not always
                     reliable) rather than on a perusal of articles and reviews, the names of
                     authors are not regularized, keyword access is not based on a controlled
                     thesaurus, some records lack full bibliographical information, and coverage of
                     topics is haphazard. Users should remember that recent volumes are not indexed;
                     for example, of the 1,061 journals listed under Literature in
                        <em class="citetitle">Index</em>, fewer than 100 are covered beyond 1995 (with
                     coverage rarely extending beyond 2000). Before using <em class="citetitle">Periodicals
                        Index Online</em>, researchers should consult Robert Balay’s
                     evaluation (pp. 13–20) in <em class="citetitle">Early Periodical Indexes</em>
                        (<a class="link" href="ch07.xhtml#G327" title="G327">G327</a>), keeping in mind that
                     the current search interface is substantially better than earlier ones. In
                     their current state, <em class="citetitle">Archive</em> and
                        <em class="citetitle">Index</em> are primarily useful to language and literature
                     researchers as a supplement to the other serial bibliographies in this
