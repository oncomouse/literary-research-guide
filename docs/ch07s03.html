                     reviews from more than one periodical. The 512 entries are organized by author
                     or title in nine variously classified subject divisions: general works
                     (including general book review indexes); philosophy and psychology; religion;
                     social sciences (with a section for anthropology and folklore); ancient, Asian,
                     and African civilizations; modern languages, philology, and literature;
                     geography and history; fine arts (with sections for the performing arts and
                     theater and drama); and science and technology. In the language and literature
                     division, sections for general indexes, comparative literature, and periods are
                     followed by sections for various languages, with that for English subdivided by
                     period. Additions are printed on pp. 194–97. Annotations first describe the
                     general scope of a work, then the organization of review citations. Five
                     indexes: subjects; persons who are the subjects of bibliographies; titles;
                     works indexing reviews before 1900 and before 1800; country of origin (listing
                     works that review or cite periodicals published in a single country). The lack
                     of headings for sections leaves readers unable to skim effectively or locate a
                     work easily, but the full descriptions and international coverage make Gray an
                     indispensable guide to identifying sources that index reviews. A revised,
                     updated edition that evaluates sources is badly needed, however.</p><p class="annotation">Supplemented by Donald Altschiller and Sarah G. Wenzel,

                     issues incompletely indexed; and the compilation procedures and editing hardly
                     inspire confidence in the accuracy and thoroughness. However, the breadth of
                     coverage—the most wide-ranging of any single index—makes
                        <em class="citetitle">IBR</em> a useful complement to the other review indexes
