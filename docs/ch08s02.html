                  accepted by North American and some foreign institutions since 1637. The database
                  now cites dissertations from most United States and Canadian institutions (and,
                  since 1988, many British ones), but coverage in the early years is considerably
                  less thorough, and some universities still do not submit abstracts or
                  dissertations for reproduction. Coverage of dissertations outside North America is
                  superficial. A list of participating institutions is printed at the beginning of
                  each issue of <em class="citetitle">DAI</em> (some lists cite the year an institution
                  began submitting dissertations).</p><p class="annotation">Because of the massive number of records and the inadequacies
                  of the indexing and organization of the print versions, the electronic versions
                  offer the best access; however, since these do not include abstracts before July
                  1980 for dissertations and before 1988 for theses or include records from
                     <em class="citetitle">DAI</em> pt. C before vol. 49 (1988), researchers will
                  frequently find themselves digging through stacks of the print versions. In
                  addition, effective searching of the electronic versions requires a familiarity
                  with the scope, organization, and editorial principles of
                     <em class="citetitle">DAI</em>.</p><p class="annotation">In <em class="citetitle">DAI</em> abstracts are now organized in
                  classified subject divisions. Currently, the language and literature division is
                  in two parts: (1) language, with sections for general studies, ancient languages,
                  linguistics, modern languages, and rhetoric and composition; (2) literature, with
                  sections for general, classical, comparative, medieval, modern, African, American,
                  Asian, Canadian, Caribbean, English, Germanic, Latin American, Middle Eastern,
                  Romance, and Slavic and East European literatures. Theater and cinema appear as
                  sections in the communication and the arts division; folklore, in the social
                  sciences division; and women’s studies, once in the social sciences division, is
                  now a separate division. Since placement is determined by the dissertation author,
                  subject classification is frequently inconsistent or imprecise. Within each
                  section, abstracts are now listed alphabetically by author.</p><p class="annotation">An entry consists of title, UMI order number, author, degree,
                  institution, date of degree, number of pages, sometimes the dissertation adviser,
                  and an abstract written by the author. Abstracts sometimes include untranslated
                  HTML codes; copyediting is negligent; and in some volumes, many titles have
                  keywords added parenthetically to facilitate electronic searches—e.g., “Working
                  Fictions: Narratives of Women and Labor in Early Modern England (William
                  Shakespeare, Mary, Lady Wroth, Thomas Heywood, Aemilia Lanyer)” (these
                  parenthetical keywords are now stripped out of database records). Entries in pt. C
                  add an English translation of a foreign language title and ISBN for a published
                  dissertation or information on location or availability of a reference copy if the
                  work is unavailable from UMI. In recent years, UMI’s rigorous enforcement of a
                  350-word limit results in some abstracts being cut off in mid-sentence or
                  shortened by UMI.</p><p class="annotation">Since vol. 30 (1969), each issue of
                     <em class="citetitle">DAI</em> has keyword title and dissertation author indexes,
                  with the latter cumulated at the end of a volume. Earlier issues and volumes have
                  a dissertation author index, and vols. 22–29 (1961–69) are indexed by subject.

                  Xerox, 1970), is superseded by the electronic versions. The keyword access to
                  abstracts is particularly welcome because of the sometimes imprecise subject
                  classification of <em class="citetitle">DAI</em> and the recent trend toward
                  uninformative, imprecise dissertation titles in the humanities.</p><p class="annotation">Researchers without access to one of the electronic versions
                  should consult <em class="citetitle">Comprehensive Dissertation Index</em>, a keyword
                  index to dissertations in the <em class="citetitle">Dissertation Abstracts
                     Database</em>. Entries are now organized by broad subject divisions,
                  then alphabetically by keyword, and then alphabetically by author. An entry cites
                  title, author, degree, date, institution, number of pages, source of entry, and
                  UMI order number. Indexed by dissertation author in each cumulation and annual
                  issue. Users must bear in mind the following:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p class="list-item">The subject organization has changed during the course
                        of publication (e.g., in the 1861–1972 cumulation, theater is a subdivision

                        sciences; in the 1973–82 cumulation and subsequent issues, theater and

                        and, if possible, should search for narrow rather than broad terms (e.g., in
                           <em class="citetitle">1861–1972</em>, “novel” and related terms occupy 37
                        columns). Foreign language titles are only indexed by their English-language

                     <em class="citetitle">Dissertation Abstracts Online</em>. Both allow users to
                  narrow a search by combining or excluding keywords and to limit it by such fields
                  as degree date, adviser, language, or institution. ProQuest’s search interface
                     (<a class="link" href="ch09s02.xhtml#I519" title="I519">I519</a>) has a customized search

                  searches other databases along with <em class="citetitle">ProQuest Dissertations and
                     Theses</em>. Basic Search allows keyword searches of all record fields.
                  Advanced Search allows users to limit searches of Boolean combinations of record
                  fields in a pull-down menu by full text, date, degree-granting institution,
                  manuscript type (doctoral dissertations or master’s theses), subject, adviser,
                  index term, and language. Advanced Search includes three subscreens: Look Up
                  Citation, Command Line, and Find Similar (i.e., search for related content).
                  Browse allows searches of lists of subject and of location (countries and states
                  [in the United States]). Results can be sorted by date (ascending or descending)
                  or relevance (although there is no explanation about how the latter is
                  established) and narrowed by nested menus. Searches can be saved as alerts
                  (however, the monthly lists frequently duplicate records from earlier lists), used
                  to create an RSS feed, or stored in a user’s My Research account. Searchers should
                  avoid using the Literature &amp; Language customized search form: it is designed
                  for searching published documents. Inexperienced searchers should begin with
