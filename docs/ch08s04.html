                  the 25,953 entries are organized by date of acceptance in 35 classified divisions:
                  Anglo-Saxon; English language and linguistics; Chaucer; Middle English;
                  Renaissance; Shakespeare; seventeenth century; Milton; eighteenth century;
                  Romantic period; Victorian period; twentieth century; drama and theater; English

                  American literature; American poetry; American literary relationships;
                  miscellaneous topics in American literature. Most divisions are extensively
                  classified by subjects, groups, genres, movements, or individual authors. An entry
                  consists of author, title, date of acceptance, a code number that identifies the
                  institution, and, in the 1969–73 supplement, number of pages. Two indexes in each
                  volume: a cross-index of literary authors in the titles of multiple-author
                  studies; dissertation writers. McNamee must be used with due regard for its
                  numerous limitations and deficiencies:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p class="list-item">The work falls far short of the complete list it claims
                        to be. Restricted to studies written in English departments, it ignores
                        numerous dissertations on English and American literature produced in
                        history, comparative literature, and (especially) theater or drama
                        departments. And there are many omissions of dissertations accepted by
                        English departments.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="list-item">Dissertations are frequently difficult to locate because
                        titles determine placement in divisions and classified sections, many of
                        which are insufficiently exclusive. Particularly vexing are the numerous
                        classified sections that are frequently imprecise in heading, inconsistent
                        across divisions, and organized in no discernible manner (e.g., related
                        topics are rarely grouped together). Because a dissertation is listed in
                        only one section and multiple-author studies are placed under the first
                        author mentioned, users searching for dissertations on specific writers must
                        be certain to check the cross-index of authors, which is unhelpfully keyed
                        to the numbered sections rather than to pages. The vagueness and
                        inconsistencies in subject classifications and inadequate indexing mean that
                        researchers must exercise considerable ingenuity to locate
                        dissertations.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="list-item">There are numerous typographical errors, and the

                  language and literature in English accepted by German universities between 1885
                  and 1950, by the University of Strassburg up to 1918, and by Austrian universities
                  from 1938 to 1945. The approximately 3,000 entries are organized in three
                  divisions: linguistics, with dissertations listed by year of acceptance within
                  sections for general studies, phonetics, orthography, morphology, etymology,
                  syntax, dialect and slang, stylistics, and prosody; literature, with sections for
                  Great Britain (including subsections for genres, motifs and topics, influences,
                  and individual periods), the Commonwealth, and the United States (including
                  subsections for general studies and individual periods); theater. In the
                  literature and theater divisions, dissertations are organized alphabetically by a
                  title keyword, which is set in spaced type. An entry cites author, title, number
                  of pages, publication information for dissertations published in a series or
                  periodical, an indication of manuscript (“HS”) or typescript (“MS”) for those not
                  printed, institution, and year of acceptance. Indexed by dissertation authors and
                  title keywords.</p><p class="annotation">The subject indexing by title keyword is frequently imprecise
                  or misleading (and the spaced type is not immediately recognizable), but the poor
                  subject indexing is a minor deficiency in comparison to the frequent errors in
                  citations and numerous omissions. (In <em class="citetitle">Guide to Doctoral Dissertations

                  dissertations overlooked by Mummendey.) While useful for compiling a preliminary
                  list of German dissertations on a topic, Mummendey must be supplemented by a
