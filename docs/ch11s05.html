                  English- and (beginning in vol. 41 [for 2010]) Spanish-language reference works
                  (print and electronic) published or distributed in the United States or Canada
                  (with decent coverage of the latter beginning in vol. 18 [1987]). Although
                  claiming comprehensive coverage, <em class="citetitle">ARBA</em> actually overlooks or
                  ignores each year a substantial number of major works within its scope. Reviews
                  are organized in four extensively classified divisions: general reference works
                  (organized by types of works, including bibliographies, biographical sources,
                  directories, encyclopedias, and indexes), social sciences (including sections for
                  ethnic studies and anthropology, genealogy, history, library science, publishing
                  and bookselling, and women’s studies), humanities (including general works;
                  language and linguistics; literature; mythology, folklore, and popular culture;
                  and performing arts), and science and technology. The literature section has
                  subdivisions for general works, children’s literature, drama, fiction, poetry,
                  nonfiction, and national literatures (with each of the national literatures having
                  sections, as needed, for general works, genres, and individual authors). Some
                  reviews conclude with citations to others in library journals. Two indexes:
                  authors and titles; subjects. Cumulative indexes: Joseph W. Sprug,

                  <em class="citetitle">ARBAonline</em> includes reviews from vol. 28 (1997) forward,
                  with new reviews added each month. Users can search by keyword, author or editor,
                  ISBN or ISSN, publisher, subject, and title; searches can be limited to classified
                  divisions and their subheadings (see above), <em class="citetitle">ARBA</em> volume,
                  monthly update (important for those who want to keep current with new reference
                  works; click the last search box in the ARBA Volume line for a pull-down menu),
                  and publication date of the work reviewed. Users can also browse records by
                  subject or by update. Results—which can be sorted by author or editor, publication
                  date, publisher, <em class="citetitle">ARBA</em> volume, relevancy (called # of
                  Terms), or title—can be saved to a list for printing (but not downloading or
                  e-mailing), but each review must be printed separately.
                     <em class="citetitle">ARBAonline</em> saves researchers from having to consult the
                  individual print volumes and is more current than <em class="citetitle">ARBA</em>, but
                  users who want to retrieve more than a couple records will justifiably chafe at
                  having to print (or save through a Web browser) one review at a time.</p><p class="annotation">Although the quality of the reviews has improved a bit over
                  the years, too many remain essentially descriptive, and many that attempt
                  evaluation are simply inaccurate or insufficiently rigorous. In recent volumes,
                  too many reviews are by the editor or an unidentified staff reviewer. Omitting too
                  many significant publications within its scope and insufficiently rigorous in
                  evaluations, <em class="citetitle">ARBA</em> is primarily useful for alerting
                  researchers to some new reference books and to changes in serial ones (which are
                  examined at intervals).</p><p class="annotation">Selected reviews are reprinted in <em class="citetitle">Best Reference

                  the past year. The notices, which have been signed only since vol. 22 (1984), are
                  organized by subject areas, including the humanities, language and literature
                  (classified by language), performing arts (with sections for film and theater),
