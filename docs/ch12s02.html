                           guide to criticism from 1900 to 1982. The approximately 2,500 entries are
                           organized in classified divisions for bibliographies, national
                           literatures (English, American, Canadian, French, and German, with

                           (e.g., parodies, vampire, death by spontaneous combustion, film). Two

                           <em class="citetitle">Guide to the Gothic II</em> is both a sequel to and
                           expansion of its parent volume. The 1,547 entries, which offer fuller,
                           more evaluative annotations, are organized in divisions for reference
                           works, general studies, English literature (in which Canadian writers are
                           inexplicably included), American writers, other national literatures, and
                           subjects. Two indexes: critics; authors and titles of Gothic

                           note that each volume, inexplicably, is indexed separately by critics and
                           authors or by titles of Gothic fiction. Despite these quirks (and the
                           italicization of authors of dissertations and theses), <em class="citetitle">Gothic
                              III</em> continues to offer full, evaluative annotations (the

                           follows Frank’s organization. Many entries in the alphabetical list lack
                           a full citation, and the static Web pages must be searched through a
                           browser’s find function.</p><p class="annotation">A necessary complement is Benjamin Franklin Fisher

                           Reference Lib. of the Humanities 567). Emphasizing British and American
                           writers, Fisher includes much nineteenth-century criticism; is more
                           thorough than Frank in covering many authors and topics; offers brief
                           evaluations in many annotations; and provides indexes of subjects,
                           scholars, and titles of literary works. Users will, however, regret the
                           ill-advised decisions to exclude a number of important studies because
                           they appear in other bibliographies of the Gothic and to conclude with

                           selective overviews of foreign language periodicals. Excludes
                           publications restricted to members of Sherlock Holmes organizations.
                           Organized alphabetically by title (with cross-references for variants),
                           the entries for the English-language periodicals include a discussion of
                           publishing history and general content; a selected list of studies,
                           indexing sources, and locations (with many citing only private
                           collections); and information on title changes, volume and issue
                           numbering and dates, publisher(s), editor(s), price, size and pagination,
                           and current status. Two other divisions offer basic overviews and lists
                           by country of foreign language magazines and discussions of book clubs.
                           Seven appendixes: United States, English, and Canadian magazines,
                           classified by country, then format for fiction and subject for nonfiction

                           collector. Concludes with a selected bibliography. The index of titles,
                           persons, publishers, and some subjects excludes the division listing
                           foreign language magazines. Given the ephemeral nature and short lives of
                           many of these publications, the lack of publishing details and few
                           locations for many entries is not surprising. Although the essays vary

                        establishing a poetics of the genre and tracing its early evolution. Based
                        on Marxist ideology, the first part presents the theoretical foundation,
                        which defines science fiction as “the literature of cognitive estrangement”
                        and emphasizes utopian literature while largely excluding myth and fantasy.
                        The second part traces the evolution of European and American science
                        fiction from More through Wells, with a brief excursion into
                        early-twentieth-century Russian works and a chapter on Karel Čapek.
                        Concludes with a selected bibliography. Indexed by persons. Although
                        reviewers justifiably find the discussion of poetics too restrictive, most
                        agree that Suvin is an important, provocative contribution to the study of
                        the genre. Reviews: Dagmar Barnouw, <em class="citetitle">MLN</em> 95.5 (1980):

                           social and technical extrapolation and invention,” but the second volume

                           but not published). The 2007 release covers more than 17,420 issues for
                           1,244 publications, with separate indexes of magazine titles, authors and
                           artists, stories listed alphabetically by author, stories listed by
                           title, works about authors, stories listed chronologically by author,
                           series, cover artists, and magazines with issues listed by date. Given
                           the extensive hyperlinking and the lack of any search capability beyond
                           that of the user’s Web browser, several of the separate indexes could be
                           conflated so that users don’t have to click through successive indexes in
                           order to assemble a full citation for a story. Titles are followed by an
                           abbreviation that identifies genre or type of work (e.g., interview,
                           letter, cartoon); since space is not a concern on the CD-ROM, users would
                           be better served by expanded abbreviations instead of having to consult
                           the list of abbreviations. Concludes with a list of missing issues, a
                           hyperlink to an online addendum (last updated in 2000), and a notes
                           section, which includes a poorly identified and murky user’s guide; the
                           last, along with a clear explanation of the scope and editorial
                           procedures, should be at the very top of the opening screen. Although in
                           need of proofreading, the conflation of some of the separate lists, and

                           journals from 1882 through 1983. The entries are organized in four
                           divisions: 279 English-language magazines, 15 paperback English-language
                           anthology series associated with magazines, 72 scholarly journals and
                           major fanzines, and 184 foreign language magazines. The first three
                           divisions are organized alphabetically by title (with cross-references
                           for variant titles); the last by country, then title. In the first and
                           second divisions, the separately authored profiles consist of a
                           discussion of publishing history, editorial policies, contents,
                           personnel, and significance; a selective list of scholarship, indexing
                           sources, reprints, and locations; and details of title changes, volume
                           and issue data, publisher(s), editor(s), format, and price. Entries in
                           the other divisions offer much less detailed information on scope,
                           contents, beginning and ending dates, and publishing information.
                           Concludes with two appendixes (index to major cover artists; chronology
                           of English-language magazines from 1882 through 1983) and a selective
                           bibliography. The persons, titles, and awards index excludes foreign
                           language magazines. Although the entries vary in amount of detail and
