                        vision of a discrete period of literary history,” all give attention to the
                        institutions associated with literary creation, forms and genres, and “the
                        relationship between literature and broader historical continuities and
                        transformations.” The selective bibliographies that conclude each volume
                        vary substantially in their quality: some (e.g., Simpson) are little more
                        than inadequate—and sometimes untrustworthy—lists of editions and studies;
                        others (e.g., Davis) offer fuller, evaluative guides to further reading.

                        to each county. Among the topics covered are the physical environment;

                        topography (with descriptions of manors, estates, and other places); and

                        county when all the volumes are published. The quality of the essays varies
                        considerably, but coverage has generally become more thorough over the
                        years; however, there is no consistency in the publication schedule of
                        volumes for each county. Although frequently pedestrian, the volumes offer
                        an incomparable accumulation of local history. The <em class="citetitle">General

                     (although the last two are treated less fully than in the fourth edition). The
                     31 pages devoted to four prefatory essays (“Literary Culture and the Novel in
                     the New Millennium,” “Cultures of Reading,” “Black British Literature,” and
                     “Children’s Literature”) could better be filled instead with additional
                     entries. The seventh edition offers enhanced coverage of science fiction,
                     fantasy, postcolonial literature, travel writing, and (especially) children’s
                     literature. There is a helpful index of new and extensively revised entries

                     critical evaluation, although the latter is inevitably present. Discussions of
                     authors are very inconsistent in directing readers to standard editions and
                     critical works. This edition concludes with a chronology and lists of poets
                     laureate, children’s laureates, and literary awards, which unfortunately
                     replace the valuable appendixes that conclude the fifth and earlier editions

                     published in the English-speaking Commonwealth and the United States after

                     books, printing and publishing, and any other books published in English in
                     Great Britain or by British authors abroad, from the establishment of printing
                     in England, except for material on modern (post-1890) printing and publishing
                     not primarily of bibliographical or literary interest. Coverage was extended
                     back to the beginning of printing in Britain by <em class="citetitle">British Book Trade,

                     bibliographical and textual discussions in editions; catalogs of manuscripts;
                     and most library, auction, booksellers’, and private library catalogs. During
                     the course of publication, Howard-Hill has included some studies in foreign
                     languages and on foreign language books published in Britain; has added
                     coverage of manuscripts before 1475 by authors for whom studies of printed
                     books are listed; has included some material on some modern private presses,
                     studies published before 1890, and discussions in editions; and has modified
                     organization and citation form. For a full discussion of changes in scope, see

                     within sections. The brief descriptive annotations frequently note contents and
                     selected reviews. Since a work is usually entered only once and seldom
                     cross-referenced, users must check the index volume (vol. 6) or the CD-ROM
                     accompanying <em class="citetitle">British Book Trade, 1475–1890</em> to locate all
                     entries relevant to an author or topic.</p><p class="annotation">Vol. 1 classifies enumerative bibliographies (published c.
                     1890–1969) in divisions for general bibliographies, periods, regions (generally
                     works printed at or written by inhabitants of—rather than those about—a place),
                     book production and distribution, forms and genres (e.g., ballads, emblem
                     books, forgeries, poetry, unfinished books), subjects (e.g., alchemy, circus,
                     fencing, tobacco, witchcraft), and authors. Under some literary authors, the
                     bibliographies of primary works are preceded by a selective list of
                     bibliographies of scholarship; both are organized by date of publication, and
                     the latter sometimes admits works belonging to the former list. The brief
                     descriptive annotations frequently note organization, type of bibliography,
                     content of bibliographical descriptions, revised editions or supplements
                     published after 1969, and reviews. Indexed by persons and subjects; vol. 6 also

                     bibliography and textual criticism, moves authors to the general and period
                     bibliography division, emphasizes works about places in the regional division,
                     and combines forms and subjects. The author and title index and the subject
                     index are on a CD-ROM.</p><p class="annotation">Vol. 2 organizes Shakespearean textual and bibliographical
                     research (published c. 1890 through 1995) in divisions for general
                     bibliographies and guides, editions (with sections on quartos and the various
                     folios), and textual studies (with sections on handwriting and paleography,
                     collected emendations, and individual works). Bibliographies appear first in
                     each section, followed by studies in chronological order. Coverage of suggested
                     emendations is not complete. Two indexes: persons; subjects.</p><p class="annotation">Vols. 4 and 5 classify bibliographical and textual studies

                     bibliography; book production and distribution; forms, genres, and subjects;
                     and authors. Only a very few entries are annotated. Corrections appear in vol.

                     persons and titles of anonymous works; subjects. The organization of the
                     subject index requires considerable study before it can be used efficiently, as
                     it must be if all entries on an author or subject are to be located.</p><p class="annotation">Vol. 7 continues the coverage of vols. 1, 2, 4, and 5 but

                     (such as <em class="citetitle">Beowulf</em>). The most important or useful
                     separately published English-language works (through early 1997) receive full
                     entries, with annotations frequently citing journal articles and sections of

                     descriptions of scope, organization, contents, kinds of annotations, and
                     indexing), helpfully cite related or superseded works, usually compare works
                     when two or more are listed under an author, and—unlike in the first
                     edition—are more pointedly evaluative. Unfortunately, the indexing is
                     inadequate: main entries are indexed by persons and titles; titles of books
                     (but not their authors or editors) cited in annotations are indexed
                     (unaccountably by page rather than entry number like other titles); journal
                     articles mentioned in annotations are not indexed. Nonetheless, Bracken is an
                     invaluable starting place for identifying and sorting through published

                           manuscripts, including an author’s typescripts, corrected proof sheets,
                           diaries, notebooks, and marginalia in printed books, but excluding
                           letters; scribal copies to c. 1700 are also included. The individual
                           volumes are organized alphabetically by author, with entries listed as
                           the nature of the surviving manuscripts and canon demands. An
                           introduction to each author describes the manuscripts generally,
                           summarizes scholarship, alerts researchers to special problems, comments
                           on nonliterary papers, discusses canon, and concludes with an outline of
                           the arrangement of entries. A typical entry provides a physical
                           description, dates composition of the manuscript, lists editions and
                           facsimiles, notes provenance, cites relevant scholarship, and identifies
                           location (with shelf mark). Additions and corrections were to be printed
                           in vol. 5, but publication of the <em class="citetitle">Index</em> ceased in
                           1997. Since some entries are based on inquiries to libraries and
                           collectors, on bibliographies and other reference works, and on
                           booksellers’ and auction catalogs, rather than on personal examination by

                           and format also vary somewhat from volume to volume. Although there are
                           inevitable errors and omissions, and although the scope is unduly
                           restricted by reliance on the <em class="citetitle">Concise Cambridge

                           the metadata associated with a manuscript can be searched; the text of
                           the manuscript itself is not searchable. Records can be searched in three
                           ways: Search, Advanced Search, and Browse. Search allows a keyword search
                           of the citation or catalog entry to be limited by century. Advanced
                           Search allows Boolean searches of fields (full citation or catalog entry,
                           document author, title, document type, persons about, manuscript number,
                           Gale document number, and previous search) to be limited by date,
                           document type, source library, specific library collection, and source
                           microfilm collection. Browse is limited to document authors. Users can
                           search both modules simultaneously or select one. Results can be sorted
                           by relevance, source library or collection, or manuscript number and can
                           be narrowed by document author, document type, century, or source library
                           (the pull-down menu helpfully generates links). For each record, a
                           searcher can elect to view the manuscript, thumbnail images, or full
                           citation and to mark records (not the manuscripts themselves) for viewing
                           or comparing manuscripts, downloading, printing, bookmarking, or
                           e-mailing. Images of the manuscripts can be resized to fit the full
                           screen (a necessity for most of the images); a screen image—which
                           consists of two manuscript pages—can be bookmarked, and up to eight
                           images at a time can be printed or downloaded as a PDF file. The quality
                           of the microfilm images varies, and many screen images are inevitably
                           difficult—and sometimes impossible—to read, but this archive offers a
                           valuable resource that allows a researcher to do meaningful preliminary
                           work before sitting in front of the actual manuscript.</p></section></section></section></section><section class="section" id="M1e2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">Printed Works</h4></div></div></div><section class="section" id="M1376"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title">M1376</h5></div></div></div><section class="section" id="M1376c"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6 class="title"/></div></div></div><p id="M1376c1" class="citation">

                        limiting the index to persons makes it impossible to use the collection to
                        trace across periods or critical schools the effects of a methodology,

                        and about “literary authors native to or mainly resident in the British
                        Isles” from the Old English period through those established by 1950.
                        Because of the scope, coverage of scholarship is necessarily selective and
                        excludes unpublished dissertations, ephemeral publications, encyclopedia
                        articles, insignificant notes, and superseded studies. Parts of books are
                        omitted from the lists of secondary materials, thus leading researchers to
                        overlook important studies. Otherwise, the thoroughness of coverage and
                        terminal date (from c. 1962 to 1969) vary widely from section to section,
                        with only extended use revealing how adequate an individual part is.</p><p class="annotation">Entries are organized by literary period and then by
                        six major divisions (each extensively subdivided and classified as its
                        subject and the period require): introduction, poetry, novel, drama, prose,
                        and Scottish or Anglo-Irish. For a fuller account of the organization of
                        each period, see entries for the individual volumes.</p><p class="annotation">Listings under individual authors are divided into
                        bibliographies, collections, primary works, and secondary materials.
                        Headnotes sometimes locate manuscripts or unique items. The full entry for
                        an author who writes in several genres appears under the genre with which he
                        or she is most closely associated; briefer entries emphasizing primary works
                        usually appear under other genres or forms. Since these entries are not
                        always cross-referenced, users must check the index volume (vol. 5) to
                        locate all listings for an author. In the various subdivisions and author
                        entries, primary and secondary works are listed chronologically by date of
                        publication. Editions and translations follow, in chronological order, a
                        primary work. When a list of secondary materials includes more than one
                        study by a scholar, the chronological sequence is unnecessarily violated by
                        grouping all the studies under the earliest publication date of those cited.
                        This practice, which requires considerable backtracking in lengthy lists
                        (since scholars are not indexed), is almost universally condemned by
                        reviewers and users.</p><p class="annotation">Scholars are identified by surname and initial(s);
                        titles are short titles, with only the first word capitalized and no
                        designation of a title within a title; bibliographical information is
                        incomplete. Although these conventions save space and create an uncluttered
                        page, they also frequently prolong searches in library catalogs and volumes
                        of journals.</p><p class="annotation">The index (vol. 5) lists literary authors, major
                        anonymous works, and some headings for subdivisions but is insufficiently
                        detailed to provide adequate access to the wealth of information in vols.
                        1–4. To be certain of locating all sections on an author, form, or genre,
                        users must consult vol. 5 rather than the provisional index in each volume.

                        organized by publication date within various subject classifications;
                        subsequent editions follow, in chronological order, the first. A typical
                        entry provides author, short title, publication information, format,
                        pagination, citations to standard bibliographies, locations, references to
                        important scholarship and contemporary reviews, and occasional notes on
                        content. Most volumes print several facsimiles of title pages and other
                        printed material. Each volume has up to four indexes: titles; authors;
                        subjects and other persons; places (however, indexing is less thorough in
                        recent volumes). Based on research in an extensive number of libraries,
                        Alston is an indispensable guide to the identification and location of works
                        essential for the study of the early history of the English language.

                        spelling, pronunciation, part of speech, any specification of vocation,
                        status, earlier spellings (with indication of chronological range), and

                        from the earliest to most recent; (4) dated illustrative quotations listed

                        collocations) are also recorded in <em class="citetitle">Oxford English Dictionary

                           other countries. Entries are organized according to the known or probable
                           date of first performance: under each century (to 1495) or year
                           (1495–1700), plays of known authorship are listed alphabetically by
                           author, followed by anonymous plays listed by title. Information is
                           presented in tabular format, with columns for author, title, date of
                           first performance (when known), type of play, auspices of first
                           production (including acting company and place), date of first edition or
                           manuscript, and date of most recent modern edition (which is not always
                           the best edition). To decipher information in the columns, users must
                           refer continually to the explanation of symbols in the introduction (some
                           symbols can be deciphered only by consulting the second edition).
                           Following the chronology are supplementary lists of plays omitted because
                           of uncertain date or identity, of selected collections of medieval drama
                           texts, and of theaters. An appendix lists extant play manuscripts, with
                           location and shelf number. Five indexes: English playwrights (including
                           collected editions); English plays (including modern editions, both
                           printed and in dissertations); foreign playwrights; foreign plays
                           translated or adapted; dramatic companies. The third edition incorporates
                           scholarship through the late 1980s but remains as conservative as its
                           predecessor in dating and attributing works. The second edition (1964)
                           with its supplements (1966, 1970) of the <em class="citetitle">Annals</em>
                           was an authoritative accumulation of factual information and an essential
                           source for investigating the environment of a play or the evolution of
                           the early drama; the same cannot be said for the third edition, which is
                           so rife with errors, misprints, omissions, and inconsistencies that it
                           cannot be trusted. Researchers must consult the second edition and its

                              well as for individual sections, several of which supplement (but do

                              entries—which usually cite the “best” edition—are divided among three
                              classified divisions: theater (with sections for reference works;
                              government intervention; religion; theater arts; history; theater in

                              theater and opera, operetta, and musical comedy). Within each section,
                              books are listed chronologically (by date of edition cited, which may
                              not be the first edition), then alphabetically by author within a
                              year. Some entries are accompanied by brief annotations that provide
                              bibliographical information, list contents, or elucidate an unclear
                              title; for all but the most obscure or ephemeral works, locating the
                              copy described at one of 18 institutions is superfluous. The indexing
                              needlessly confuses users: only the first author or editor is listed
                              in the author index; all others—including writers of prefatory matter
                              or of essays mentioned in annotations—appear in the subject index.
                              Neither index is thorough. Although it excludes articles, is very
                              selective in some sections, and omits several foreign language

                              annotates major studies on versification in other languages. Pt. 1
                              treats modern poetry (since Wyatt), with sections, classified as the

                              structures, and the poem in performance. Pt. 2 divides studies between
                              sections for Old and Middle English verse. The appendix has sections
