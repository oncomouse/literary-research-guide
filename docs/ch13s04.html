                     emphasis on works produced in England. Following an admirably clear explanation
                     of the basics of online searching are chapters on general literary reference
                     sources (including some devoted to individual writers); library catalogs; print

                     periodicals; resources for studying the contemporary reception of a writer or a

                     and digital collections; and Web resources. A final chapter demonstrates how to
                     use many of the works and strategies previously discussed to develop a research
                     plan. Indexed by titles, authors, and subjects. Describing fully the uses of

                     and practice of handwriting in England; letter forms current in the fifteenth

                     in its treatment of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, it remains the best
                     introduction to the reading of the hands commonly used between 1400 and 1700.

                        Vol. 1 covers 72 British and Irish authors who flourished between 1450 and
                        1625, with the bulk dating from the latter years of the period; vol. 2
                        covers 52 authors from the years 1625–1700. The authors are essentially
                        those listed in <em class="citetitle">Concise Cambridge Bibliography of English
                           Literature, 600–1950</em> (<a class="link" href="ch13.html#M1365a">M1365a</a>). The emphasis is (rather loosely at
                        times) on literary manuscripts, including scribal copies. Letters are
                        excluded, although the introductions to individual authors list either
                        individual ones or collections. Moreover, the introductions alert
                        researchers to special problems and relevant scholarship, point out
                        additional manuscripts, discuss canon, and conclude with an outline of the
                        arrangement of entries. A typical entry provides a physical description,
                        identifies the hand(s), dates composition of the manuscript, includes any
                        necessary commentary (as well as references to editions or scholarship), and
                        identifies location (with shelf mark). Since some entries are based on
                        inquiries to libraries and collectors, bibliographies and other reference
                        works, and booksellers’ and auction catalogs, rather than personal
                        examination by the compiler, descriptions vary in fullness and accuracy.
                        Also, terminology and format vary somewhat from part to part.</p><p class="annotation">Addenda to the list of Donne manuscripts can be found

                           records relating to the ownership of written works or to members of the
                           company, as well as a number of miscellaneous documents. (See entry <a class="link" href="ch13.html#M1380" title="M1380">M1380</a> for a discussion of the
                           records of the company.) Of principal interest to literary scholars are
                           the registers of copies entered and records of fines for unlawful
                           printing. In the registers, entries are listed chronologically according
                           to the Old Style calendar and include the member entering the work (or
                           being fined), a descriptive “title” (sometimes accompanied by the
                           author’s name), and registration fee. (For the typographical distinctions
                           of parts of an entry, see vol. 1, pp. 27–30.) Users must remember that
                           (1) the registers are records of ownership claims by members of the
                           company; (2) they were never intended as a record of authorized
                           publication; (3) an entry does not automatically mean the work actually
                           existed at that date; (4) many works entered were never published (or
                           intended to be, as in the case of “blocking entries” used to prevent
                           unauthorized printing of plays) or are no longer extant; (5) many works
                           were printed with a different title; (6) sometimes a year or more elapsed
                           between entry and publication; (7) later editions, unless a transfer of
                           ownership occurred, were typically not entered; (8) a considerable number
                           of works actually printed were never entered; (9) Register B and Arber’s
                           transcript of it include entries forged by John Payne Collier (see

                           after but written before 1700. The approximately 1,800 entries are listed
                           alphabetically by author in three divisions: works by women (including
                           some of indeterminate authorship and a few published after 1700 but
                           written before that year); works about specific living or dead females
                           (but excluding fictional characters); works discovered too late to be
                           annotated and incorporated into the preceding divisions. A typical entry

                        entries are organized in a single alphabetized list followed by four
                        indexes: subjects; geographic areas; persons and anonymous works; and
                        document authors (largely superfluous given the alphabetized list of
                        entries). Earlier volumes consisted of seven divisions: studies of
                        individuals and anonymous works; general studies; history (including
                        geography and political, social, and economic history); religion,
                        philosophy, politics, and law; general literary studies, linguistics, and
                        bibliography; the arts (including music and dance); science and technology.
                        Except in the first division, which is organized alphabetically by writer,
                        historical personage, or anonymous work, studies are grouped by country or
                        geographic area, then listed alphabetically by author. Two indexes:
                        scholars; writers and other individuals not separately classified in the
                        first division. Researchers would benefit from a more refined classification
                        system and greater currency (the lag is currently five to six years).</p><p class="annotation">The online version can be searched by document author,
                        title keyword, date, subject, geographic area, and persons; before using the

                        the taxonomy of vols. 1–33 and by the indexes since vol. 34, although
                        records for essays from edited collections lack a full citation and are
                        (inexcusably) not linked to main-entry records, and although the search
                        interface is cumbersome, the online version keeps searchers from having to

                        notes on variants, and references to standard bibliographies. The entry for

                        those elsewhere in the world to the right). An extensive appendix on

                        1642; variants in earlier publications are described in the main list.

                        Wing, this work is not a census of copies and that the identification of

                           the London dramatic companies (with lists of actors and repertory) and
                           the career of each known actor (quoting in chronological order “every

                           documents. Vols. 3–5 collect biographical details on dramatists and
                           bibliographical information on plays. A typical entry for a play lists
                           editions, scholarship, and seventeenth-century records and evaluates what
                           is known of its date, authorship, source(s), allusions, and performance.
                           Vol. 6 examines the private and public London theaters. Vol. 7 prints
                           appendixes to vol. 6 (among which is a chronology of theatrical affairs)
                           and a detailed analytical index of plays, authors, scholars, actors,
                           places, and subjects. The careful evaluation of primary evidence and
                           scholarship makes Bentley the essential source for facts about acting

                           1642. Included are plays written by British expatriates and translations
                           by British authors of foreign plays; for criteria determining inclusion
                           of such forms as dialogues, civic pageants, tilts, masques, and royal
                           entertainments, see vol. 1, pp. xii–xx. A supplementary list of plays
                           written before 1533 and printed or transcribed between 1533 and 1642
                           appears in vol. 1, pp. 471–72. Two appendixes are planned for the final

                           requires close familiarity with the description of scope and procedures
                           in the introduction. Although the indexing by psychological state and
                           type is sometimes inexact, surname and given name are not indexed
                           together, and variants of the same name are entered separately, the work
                           is a valuable resource for character studies of the drama. Reviews:

                              for dramatists (excluding Shakespeare) and plays from 1580 to 1642.
                              Coverage extends from 1923 to 1968–76, supplemented by some important
                              earlier and later publications (see the preface to each volume for
                              details of coverage). Each volume consists of chapters on individual
                              major writers, anonymous works, and minor dramatists. Those on
                              individual authors are in three parts: (1) a survey of biographical
                              and general studies of the plays as well as nondramatic works; (2) a
                              survey of criticism of individual plays (with plays awkwardly arranged
                              in order of critical importance) and a summary of the state of
                              scholarship; (3) a survey of scholarship on canon, dating, and textual
                              studies and a critique of editions. A selective bibliography of
                              studies not discussed concludes each chapter. Anonymous plays are
                              grouped by date of performance in a single chapter with sections, when
                              necessary, on editions, authorship, date, source, genre, and general
                              studies. The chapter on minor dramatists consists of an annotated
                              bibliography of studies and editions. Two indexes: persons; plays.
                              Although the extent and quality of evaluation vary from contributor to
                              contributor and although many playwrights are now the subjects of more
