                     evaluate new approaches to the literature of the period. The essays—written by
                     a veritable who’s who of Restoration and eighteenth-century scholars—treat
                     literary production and dissemination, genres, literature and intellectual
                     life, literature and social and institutional change, and new forms of literary

                           available to the public (as of June 1994) in the British Isles are
                           listed. Under each author, manuscripts are listed alphabetically by
                           title, followed by editorial correspondence files, and then letters in
                           chronological order (collections of letters are listed by date of the
                           earliest one). A typical entry consists of title or description, date,
                           physical description, location, shelf mark, and a note on access.
                           Important recipients of letters are interfiled in the author list. When
                           appropriate, an author section begins with a headnote on major
                           collections (especially outside Great Britain), an author’s policy on the
                           disposition of his or her papers, or the destruction of manuscripts.
                           Because of the descriptive titles given several items, researchers must
                           read the entire section for an author. Although the descriptions vary in
                           detail (and are frequently based on finding aids supplied by repositories
                           rather than personal examination) and although letters in large

                        in seven divisions: printing and bibliographical studies; historical,
                        social, and economic studies; philosophy, science, and religion; fine arts

                        and languages; British literatures; and New World literatures and languages.
                        Some articles are descriptively annotated (and sometimes evaluated);
                        significant books are stringently reviewed by specialists (although the

                        the 1980s). Some entries for books cite reviews. Indexed since 1970 by
                        persons (since indexing is by page number, users sometimes have to scan

                        organized alphabetically in seven divisions: bibliographies and
                        bibliographical studies; corantos, newsbooks, and newsletters; general
                        studies; works on individual newspapers and periodicals, editors, authors,
                        publishers, towns, and counties (classified by newspaper, editor, etc.);
                        subjects; newspapers and periodicals in Europe (classified by country);
                        newspapers and periodicals in North America (classified by country, then
                        province or state). The last three divisions are highly selective. Several
                        entries are accompanied by brief descriptive annotations, which include
                        citations to selected reviews. Indexed by authors (excluding those who
                        appear as a heading in the fourth division). Although the work is badly
                        dated, its coverage of pre-1941 scholarship on serials published before 1789
                        remains unsuperseded. For studies of periodicals published after 1789, see

                           1710 in two parts: an examination of the dramatic types in theory and
                           practice; and a decade-by-decade analysis of theatrical fashions,
                           particularly as they are influenced by political and social change. Two
                           indexes: names and subjects; plays. A provocative, scholarly work on a
                           neglected period of the drama, but Hume’s categorization of types of
                           plays and individual readings have elicited some controversy. Reviews:

                              English-language studies, and researchers must read the prefatory list
                              of topics excluded before consulting the guide. Unlike other volumes
                              in the series, this one consists of a series of surveys of research in
                              two divisions. The first examines general works in sections for
                              reference works, collections, playhouses and audience, biography,
                              dramatic theory, history of drama, general criticism, and antecedents
                              and influences. The second treats a variety of playwrights, major and
                              minor. The commentary tends toward brief description, with occasional
                              incisive evaluations and perceptive suggestions for research. The
                              format—more effective for the treatment of individual authors than for
                              general topics—does not accommodate scanning. Two indexes: persons;
                              play titles. Accuracy, judicious selectivity and evaluation, clear

                           in three classified sections: reference materials; background studies of

                           language and versification). The second is devoted to 31 poets, each with

                           Martin’s, 1989; 158 pp.; Annotated Critical Bibliogs.). Users should note
                           that Nokes and Barron offers a highly selective guide to the most
                           important or representative English-language scholarship; is marred by an
                           organizational scheme that unnecessarily separates books, articles, and
                           parts of books in the generally brief chronological lists under each
                           author; omits Swift since he was to have been the subject of a separate
                           volume in the series; and renders superfluous the needlessly complex
                           entry number system by citing page numbers in the indexes of scholars and
                           literary authors.</p></section></section><section class="section" id="idm303122187024"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6 class="title">See also</h6></div></div></div><p class="reference">Donow, <em class="citetitle">Sonnet in England and
