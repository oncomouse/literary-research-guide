                           <em class="citetitle">NCBEL</em>, scholars are identified by surname and
                        initial(s), titles are sometimes shortened, and page numbers are not given
                        for essays in periodicals—practices that deter users from actually laying
                        hands on works cited. Indexed by writers and a few subdivision headings;
                        fuller indexing was to have been offered by vol. 6. Predictably, entries for
                        authors and subjects vary in their thoroughness, consistency, accuracy, and
                        currency, but the volume adds coverage of hundreds of writers and broadens
                        the notion of literature. For many authors and subjects, it offers the
                        fullest information available on primary works, but the general exclusion of
                        post-1920 secondary works (based on the unfounded assumption that such

                        indexing is largely confined to title keywords. Separate subject indexes
                        were published through 1889; thereafter, subject heads appear in the main

                        follows the practices of the British Museum <em class="citetitle">General Catalogue of

                        vagaries of the individual catalogs. Vols. 1–4 are author catalogs, each
                        with imprint (i.e., place of publication only) and subject indexes (which
                        are cumulated in vol. 5). Vol. 5 includes subject listings (essentially

                        indexes for each; a title index to the subject listings; a supplement to
                        vols. 1–4, listing British Library accessions from 1976 to 1984; imprint and
                        subject indexes to the supplement; and cumulative imprint and subject
                        indexes to the first four volumes. (London is omitted from all the imprint
                        indexes.) Vol. 6 is a cumulative title index to vols. 1–4 and the supplement
                        in vol. 5. Although five of the six libraries included are copyright deposit
                        libraries, coverage of works published in Great Britain is not comprehensive
                        (especially for provincial and ephemeral publications); that for the rest of
                        the world is much less so. For United States imprints, bibliographies listed

                        essential to locating entries for anonymous works; but the subject indexes,
                        based on and organized by Dewey classifications, are too unrefined,
                        especially for literary topics (e.g., the English Poetry entry in

                        Although this work includes minor items that fall outside the scope of
                           <em class="citetitle">MLAIB</em> (<a class="link" href="ch07s02.html#G335" title="G335">G335</a>) and studies of American Romanticism that relate to the
                        European movement, it makes no attempt at comprehensiveness. The scope has
                        altered over the years and within individual sections so that recent volumes
                        are more critical and selective. (For an overview of changes, see David V.
                        Erdman’s foreword to the reprint of the 1936–70 bibliographies [vol. 1, pp.
                        vii–xi].) Entries are organized in six major divisions: general, English,
                        French, German, Italian, and Spanish (at various times there were divisions
                        for other national literatures such as Portuguese, Russian, and
                        Scandinavian); each national literature has sections for bibliographies,
                        general studies, and individual authors (some have a section for the
                        “environment”—art, philosophy, politics, religion, science, and society).
                        The chronological scope varies from country to country and alters to reflect
                        changes in critical perspectives (e.g., while the English section has
                        remained fairly stable at 1789–1837, the German one has undergone some major
                        shifts in chronological coverage). In the later volumes, most entries are
                        annotated: many descriptively, several critically, with a number of books
                        receiving full reviews. Recent volumes quote from other reviews. Since the
                        1961 bibliography, reviews of previously listed books, composite reviews,
                        and review essays are grouped at the end of a section. Although the later
                        annual volumes unfortunately provide only an index of critics, the reprint
                        of the 1936–70 bibliographies offers three cumulative indexes: authors, main
                        entries, reviewers; subjects: personal names; subjects: categories. Although
                        the lack of a complete subject index is inexcusable and coverage varies
                        substantially among the national literatures (Italian and Spanish are so
                        sketchily treated that their coverage should have been discontinued),
                        timeliness and judicious evaluation made this before its unfortunate demise
                        the best guide to significant scholarship on the Romantic movement. Since it
                        made no attempt at comprehensiveness, scholars must also consult “Current

                        emphasizes studies of language and literature, with some attention to other
                        subjects; for transitional authors, it includes only those studies treating
                        the Victorian period. The online version can be searched only by author,
                        title, and keyword (each limited by date; however, the date limitation
                        sometimes malfunctions). Records (which are returned only in descending
                        alphabetical order) can be marked for printing or downloading. In the print
                        versions entries are listed alphabetically by scholar in seven classified
                        divisions: general and reference works, fine arts, philosophy and religion,
                        history, social sciences, science and technology, and language and
                        literature. The last has sections for general works, reference works, drama
                        and theater, poetry, prose, fiction, children’s literature, and individual
                        authors (with lists of general works, bibliographies, biography and
                        correspondence, general criticism, and studies of individual works). A few
                        entries are accompanied by brief descriptive annotations. Users searching
                        the print versions for publications on a minor author must be sure to use
                        the subject index, since writers who are the subject of fewer than three
                        studies are lumped together under “Other Authors” in the classified
                        listings. Four indexes in each <em class="citetitle">Annual Bibliography</em>
                        and the <em class="citetitle">Cumulated Index</em> (subjects; scholars;
                        reviewers; titles of works); each volume of the <em class="citetitle">Comprehensive
                           Bibliography</em> has three indexes (subjects; scholars; titles of
                        works), and those in vol. 3 are cumulative; the <em class="citetitle">Cumulative
                           Bibliography</em> offers the same three indexes. The subject
                        indexing and keyword access in the online version, while useful, are limited
                        to literary authors and title keywords (with some significant omissions);
                        records do not consistently expand journal titles or other abbreviations (a
                        list of journal abbreviations can be accessed through the Help screen). Much
                        less accessible than it should be (especially the online version), reliant
                        on secondary sources for citations to some books rather than firsthand
                        examination, and far short of the comprehensiveness it claims,

                        contents or other material, and reviews appear in a separate file. Indexed
                        by names. The two reprints cumulate the individual indexes. Because the
                        makeup of the various circles is not consistent throughout the volumes,
                        users should consult the index to locate studies of individuals other than
                        the four principal authors. Individual annual bibliographies and sections
                        therein can be searched using a Web browser’s find function; a separate
                        Search screen allows for keyword searching of the complete bibliographies,
                        reviews, or sections. This offers fuller coverage of the six writers and

                        publications, including reviews, on Victorian England. Over the years,
                        coverage has become more inclusive but with a corresponding decrease in
                        annotations, so that recent bibliographies offer only an occasional brief
                        explanation of an uninformative title. (Early volumes offer more substantial
                        commentary, including some full reviews and quotations from others; however,
                        evaluations during the first two decades are far less rigorous than they
                        should be.) The bibliographies for 1932–74 list works alphabetically in four
                        divisions: bibliographical materials; economic, political, religious, and
                        social environment; movements of ideas, literary forms, and anthologies;
                        individual authors. With the 1975 bibliography, entries appear in one of six
                        divisions: bibliographical materials; history, historiography, and
                        historical documents; economics, education, politics, religion, science, and
                        social environment; architecture, fine arts, household arts, performing
                        arts, music, painting, photography, and sculpture; literature, literary
                        history, and literary forms; individual authors. Since the bibliography for
                        1966, listings under transitional figures such as Conrad and Shaw are
                        restricted to studies dealing with the Victorian period. Articles in author
                        journals and newsletters are awkwardly grouped under a single entry for the
                        periodical, in some volumes books are not listed unless they have been
                        reviewed, and users would benefit from a more refined classification system
                        and better cross-referencing. Until recently, the annual issues (and
                        subsequent cumulations) are seriously marred by a multitude of typographical
                        errors, inaccurate citations, and faulty cross-references. The five volumes
                        of reprints provide useful—but incomplete—cumulative indexes: of Victorian
                        authors in the 1932–44 volume; of scholars, Victorian figures, and some
                        topics in those for 1945–74; and of scholars, authors (Victorian and
                        otherwise), and subjects in that for 1975–84. The cumulation for 1965–74
                        corrects some errors (pp. 739–42) and provides an introductory statistical
                        and narrative survey of trends in scholarship for the period. For the
                        history of the print bibliography, see Edward H. Cohen, “‘Victorian

                        more than 1,000 records, they appear in no discernible order and cannot be

                        Reviews of books are not always conflated into a single record; many journal

                              three parts. Organized by periodical, pt. A is an issue-by-issue list

                              attribution of authorship, and a bibliography. Pt. B is an author

                              uneven annotations, inconsistencies in coverage, and far too many
                              errors in the citations and index), Uffelman is more accurate but also
                              offers uneven annotations (a substantial number of entries are
                              unannotated) and overlooks numerous studies, and both are
                              inefficiently organized and inadequately indexed; nevertheless, the
                              two offer the most complete guide to scholarship on the topic. They

                              first editions for authors not previously subjects of bibliographies.
                              Reflecting Sadleir’s tastes and interests, the collection emphasizes
                              rare and unusual editions of British authors between 1800 and 1899,
                              especially “Silver Fork” novels and those published in two or three
                              volumes; generally excludes major novelists and those who published
                              fiction before 1800; and includes a few foreign writers notable for
                              the rarity of their English editions and some British novels published
                              after 1900. The novels are organized in three divisions: an author
                              catalog of first editions as well as variant issues, later editions of
                              textual significance, and multiple copies; the Yellow-Back collection
                              (books issued in colored noncloth bindings); and principal series of
                              fiction and novels. Only the author catalog fully describes editions
                              by recording title, subtitle, number of volumes and pagination,
                              imprint, binding, provenance, notes on bibliographical points, and
                              references to other bibliographies. A headnote indicates the
                              completeness of each author list. (Users should note that entry
                              numbers skip from 2099 to 3000.) Indexed by titles in vol. 1, by
                              titles and by authors in vol. 2. Although the catalog includes only a
                              small fraction of the novels published during the century, the careful
                              descriptions and numerous unique items make Sadleir a valuable source
                              of bibliographical and textual information, a significant contribution
                              to the much needed record of fiction published during the nineteenth
                              century, and one of the monumental catalogs of a private collection.

                              works written by novelists during the period, novels before 1837 and
                              after 1901 by novelists published between those years, and related
                              manuscripts and letters). The collection—now owned by the Harry Ransom
                              Humanities Research Center, University of Texas, Austin—complements
                              Michael Sadleir’s, since Wolff sought the minor authors (especially
                              women) not favored by collectors. Effective use of the catalog
                              requires a copy of <em class="citetitle">XIX Century Fiction</em> (<a class="link" href="ch13s06.html#M2635" title="M2635">M2635</a>) at hand, because
                              Wolff assumes familiarity with Sadleir’s procedures and records only
                              significant variants and details of provenance for editions fully
                              described by Sadleir. The 7,938 titles (plus numerous editions thereof
                              and duplicates) are listed alphabetically by author, then title; there
                              are separate alphabetic sequences for unattributed anonymous works,
                              pseudonymous works, and multiple-author collections, annuals, and
                              periodical fiction in vol. 5. Letters relating to novels are fully
                              transcribed; manuscripts receive extensive descriptions. Entries vary
                              in content but typically include title; imprint; description of
                              binding; number of volumes and pagination; bibliographical notes, with
                              information on condition, provenance, and references to standard
                              bibliographies; and a variety of miscellaneous notes, including
                              publishing history, content, and frequently eccentric critical
                              observations. Indexed by title in vol. 5. Wolff corrected only the
                              entries from A to mid-D before his death; hence, many errors and
                              incomplete references remain, and most entries would benefit from
                              considerable pruning. (Wolff’s notecards, which are held by the Ransom
                              Center, include annotations that are not incorporated into the printed
                              catalog.) Although the work is not one of the monumental catalogs of a
                              private collection, its emphasis on minor novels, the several
                              corrections to standard author bibliographies, and descriptions of
                              numerous unique items, variant editions, manuscripts, and association
                              copies make Wolff an essential complement to Sadleir and an important

                           entertainments. Each year consists of two parts: (1) an extensive
                           overview that combines plot summary with evaluation and comments on
                           critical reception; (2) a list of productions, recording for each the
                           author, librettist, producer, director, composer, theater, opening and
                           closing dates, number of performances, original cast (along with
                           understudies and replacements), revivals, adaptations in a different
                           medium, some productions outside London (with cast lists for revivals and
                           foreign productions), and touring dates. Each volume concludes with two

                           indispensable source for the theater historian and should encourage a
