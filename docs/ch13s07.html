                     the development of English-language literature in the United Kingdom from
                     late-nineteenth-century decadence through the avant-garde, modernism, and
                     post–World War II culture to the millennium. The essays focus variously on
                     movements, groups, sociocultural influences, genres, forms, and the interaction
                     of media and literature. Unlike earlier volumes in this series, this one lacks
                     a chronology but does include a 36-page selective bibliography organized
                     unhelpfully by the five major divisions of the volume. The index of persons,
                     subjects, and titles is, as John Sutherland points out, a “disaster”; a revised

                     in its historical context, the first grouping of essays explores the form and
                     context of modernist poetry, covering such topics as race, gender, periodicals,
                     and politics. The second grouping traces origins to the nineteenth-century
                     movements such as decadence, imagism, vorticism, and the Irish revival. The
                     final eleven essays in the third grouping explore British and American poetry
                     after World War II, focusing on topics that range from Mina Loy to the Beats
                     and from objectivism to the beginnings of postcolonialism. Includes a list of

                        surveys], dissertations, articles, special issues of journals, and
                        miscellaneous materials—an organizational scheme last explained in vol. 18
                        [1993]: facing 165) in two divisions: general studies (with sections for

                        the volume consisting of separate bibliographies of Yeats, Lewis, Lawrence,
                        and Eliot. The general division on modernism includes sections for the
                        theory, literary context, critique, and critical reception of the movement;
                        fiction; poetry; drama; anthologies; general studies; and literary modernism

                        division) are accompanied by evaluative annotations that clearly delineate
                        content. Each division has two indexes: subjects; critics. There are
                        numerous important omissions (especially of works published in the 1970s),
                        the indexing system is poorly conceived, the chronological organization is
                        compromised by a failure to list numerous reprinted essays by their
                        respective years of initial publication, and scholarship on the four
                        principal authors is more adequately covered in separate author
                        bibliographies. Still, Davies is useful as a starting point because of its
                        evaluations and (in the general section) compilation of studies not readily

                           been the subjects of a “significant amount” of scholarship, but omitting
                           many who are listed in other guides in this series). Vol. 1 covers
                           English-language studies published through 1976, vol. 2, through 1980;
                           both exclude unpublished dissertations, but otherwise the criteria
                           determining selection are unstated. Entries are organized in two
                           divisions: general (with sections for bibliographies; literary histories;
                           critical studies of modern English fiction; theory of fiction; short
                           story; studies of major types; histories and memoirs; and art, film, and
                           music) and individual authors. Under each author, primary works appear
                           first (with a full list of fictional works and a selection of others);
                           secondary works are divided among bibliographies, biographical studies,
                           book-length critical works, general articles and chapters of books, and
                           studies of individual works. Although an asterisk marks important works,
                           the brief annotations rarely explain the significance of a study or offer
                           an adequate description of content. Three indexes (scholars; titles;
                           subjects) in vol. 1, but only an index of scholars in vol. 2.
                           Insufficient explanation of the criteria determining selection of authors
                           and scholarship, inadequate annotations, and the lack of a subject index
                           in vol. 2 detract significantly from the work, which is primarily useful

                              describes, by institution, significant holdings (with many

                              research make this essential reading for historians of
                              twentieth-century British and American theater. It should indeed, as
                              the author hopes, “generate research projects by other scholars and
                              encourage graduate theses.”</p></section></section></section><section class="section" id="M7j2b2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6 class="title">Calendars</h6></div></div></div><section class="section" id="M2865"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6 class="title">M2865</h6></div></div></div><section class="section" id="M2865c"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6 class="title"/></div></div></div><p id="M2865c1" class="citation"/><p>Wearing, J.

                              an individual’s commitment to the drama. The approximately 50,000

                              its organization. Under each dramatist are separate lists of primary
                              works (including only critical editions of plays, essays, collections

                           editions and studies (published in English before June 1982) of
                           nonfictional prose by 37 authors (selected for the quality of their work
                           or representativeness). Entries are organized in two divisions: general
                           and period studies; individual authors. The first division (which omits
                           some important works) includes brief sections for bibliographies,
                           literary histories, biography and autobiography, the essay and prose
                           style, literary criticism, and travel writing. Under individual authors
                           are separate lists of primary works (limited to books), editions,
                           bibliographies, biographies, and critical studies. The brief
                           annotations—essentially descriptive, with evaluative adjectives—are
                           barely adequate to convey a sense of content. Two indexes: persons;
                           titles. Although it is highly selective and partly superseded by author
                           bibliographies, <em class="citetitle">English Prose and Criticism</em> does
                           serve as a starting point for the study of nonfiction prose. Because of
                           the increasing interest in the topic, a more thorough bibliography would
                           be welcomed by scholars.</p></section></section></section></section></section></section><footer><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table style="width: 100%; "><tr><td style="width: 40%; text-align: left; "><a accesskey="p" href="ch13s06.html">Prev</a> </td><td style="width: 20%; text-align: center; "><a accesskey="u" href="ch13.html">Up</a></td><td style="width: 40%; text-align: right; "> <a accesskey="n" href="ch14.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 40%; text-align: left; vertical-align: top; ">Nineteenth-Century Literature </td><td style="width: 20%; text-align: center; "><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td style="width: 40%; text-align: right; vertical-align: top; "> Chapter 14. Irish Literature</td></tr></table></div></footer></body></html>
