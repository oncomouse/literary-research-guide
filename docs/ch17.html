                        and its historical background. Entries are organized in 35 divisions:
                        general reference works, philosophy and methodology of literary and
                        historical study, technical procedures in literary and historical research,

                        brief descriptive annotations frequently cite related works. An appendix
                        lists the principal biographies of 135 authors. Two indexes: subjects;
                        names. Many divisions would benefit from more refined classification or
                        organization; some annotations have not been revised to reflect changes in
                        scope or organization of serial publications or revised editions; and a few
                        outdated works or superseded editions should be excised. Especially valuable
                        for its interdisciplinary scope, this onetime standard guide to reference
                        works and scholarship essential to research in American literature is now in

                        (Lincoln: U of Nebraska P, 1994; 214 pp.), which is organized by kind of
                        reference work (with coverage extending through c. 1993). Works are
                        described in chapters on electronic resources; library catalogs and guides;
                        general bibliographies of American history; catalogs of books; book review
                        indexes; guides to periodical literature; guides to manuscripts; guides to

                        materials; printed documents of the federal government; the National

                        and picture sources. Unfortunately, the second edition drops the coverage of
                        specific topics such as political history, social history, ethnic groups,
                        women, blacks, American Indians, religion, regional material, and travel
                        accounts. Works are described in narrative fashion—but too rarely
                        evaluated—a practice that makes scanning difficult; coverage of electronic
                        resources is inadequate; and there are more errors and lapses in judgment
                        than one would like in an introductory guide. Indexed by persons, titles,

                     languages from twelfth-century painted cave narratives to the 1980s. Organized
                     by traditional periods (the beginnings to 1810, 1810 to 1885, 1885 to 1910,
                     1910 to 1945, 1945 to the present), each section begins with a discussion of
                     cultural and intellectual contexts and includes essays on genres, movements,
                     major writers, regions, groups, or historical developments. Rather than attempt
                     a consensus or an integrated narrative, the chapters (each by a distinguished
                     scholar) employ a variety of critical approaches and reflect the diversity of
                     the country’s literary heritage by treating ethnic, minority, regional, and
                     Native American literatures and works by women as well as established writers,
                     and popular as well as elite literature. Since many writers are discussed in
                     several chapters, users must be certain to consult the index of subjects,
                     persons, and titles. Admirably fulfilling the editor’s criteria for a good
                     literary history (“that it have a good index, readable type, sensible chapter

                     extensively on unpublished materials, Vanderbilt offers a fascinating, critical

                     bibliography, authors (organized by century, then alphabetically), genres
                     (including literary history and criticism), and ancillary subjects (including

                        institutions in the United States. Among the approximately 2,800 Americans
                        are all the major authors, selected minor ones, and several quasi-literary
                        writers such as editors, publishers, theatrical performers and producers,
                        literary critics and scholars, and a few public figures also known
                        (sometimes remotely) as writers. Following each author, holdings are listed
                        alphabetically by institutional symbol, with manuscripts identified only by
                        type and item count. (Symbols for libraries and types of manuscripts are
                        identified on pp. xxvii–liii.) A few institutional holdings are keyed to a
                        list (on pp. 367–77) of calendars, inventories, checklists, and other
                        finding aids. Concludes with two appendixes (pseudonyms and alternative
                        names; authors for whom no holdings were reported [both should have been
                        integrated into the main list of authors]) and a bibliography of catalogs
                        and guides, including ones listing American manuscripts held abroad. The
                        introduction is refreshingly frank about the limitations of the checklist,

                        holdings are not covered or are incompletely reported. Although the dense
                        pages of symbols and numbers are initially forbidding, researchers soon
                        appreciate how much drudgery this checklist can save them. Even so, much
                        work is left for users: they must write or visit institutions that have no
                        published or online finding aids to determine their exact holdings, and they

                        original edition (1971; 442 pp.) included two additional essays, on southern
                        literature. The surveys vary in selectivity, coverage of foreign scholarship
                        and dissertations, currency (generally citing publications through 1980,
                        with some as late as 1983), and organization. All have sections for
                        bibliography, editions, manuscripts and letters, biographical studies, and
                        criticism and offer suggestions for further research. The Dickinson essay
                        treats recent studies separately; others incorporate new scholarship in the
                        commentary. Unfortunately, citations do not provide full bibliographical

                        ethnicity, black history, and Native Americans); literature (with sections
                        on general surveys, historical periods, and themes); music; political
                        science; popular culture (with sections on general studies, literature,
                        various genres and types of popular fiction, comics, entertainment, film,
                        media, and material culture); psychology; religion; science, technology, and
                        medicine; and sociology. Introducing each division are a brief overview of
                        important reference works (including some published as late as 1986) and, in
                        too few instances, a discussion of criteria determining scope and selection.
                        All but a few annotations are full and accurate descriptions of content.
                        Three indexes in vol. 3: authors; titles; subjects.</p><p class="annotation">The supplement for 1984–88 separates anthropology and
                        folklore, adds a division for autobiographies and memoirs, omits science,
                        lacks the introductory overviews of reference sources, offers a brief
                        statement of general editorial policy but an inadequate explanation of the
                        scope of individual divisions, and inexplicably omits several entries that
                        appeared in the continuation of the original bibliography in
                           <em class="citetitle">Prospects: An Annual of American Cultural Studies</em>
                        10–11 (1987). Two indexes: scholars; titles (with numbers referring to pages
                        rather than entries). The lack of a subject index is inexcusable, especially
                        since so many of the books (each of which is listed in only one section)
                        cover several topics. The volumes for journal articles and books published
                        outside the United States never appeared. Although divisions vary
                        considerably in quality and authoritativeness (with many lacking a clear
                        focus and effective organization), the work offers the most extensive
                        general guide to books through 1988 on several aspects of American culture.

                        1941–47 were never published. In the volumes for 1962–1985/86, entries are
                        listed by scholar in three classified divisions: periods (including a
                        section for bibliographies), regions, and subjects (including sections for
                        literature, theater, and popular culture). Later volumes have an additional
                        division for general works (with the bibliography section relocated to here)
                        and a section for language in the subjects division. Several works receive
                        multiple listings. Indexed by authors. Earlier volumes are variously
                        organized, with the later ones having a tripartite division: the historical
                        professions; national history (with literature, theater, and folklore
                        sections in the cultural history subdivision); and regional, state, and
                        local history. Indexed by names, places, and subjects (although not all
                        volumes have subject indexing); cumulative index, 1902–40: <em class="citetitle">Index

                        written works, with the heaviest reliance on the last. A typical entry

                        from printed and oral sources. Some entries are accompanied by maps that
                        illustrate regional distribution. The admirably clear introduction in vol. 1
                        outlines the history of the dictionary; explains the editorial policy, maps,
                        and regional labels; discusses language changes especially common in
                        American folk speech; provides a guide to pronunciation; and prints the
                        questionnaire and data about the informants. Vol. 6 includes a series of
                        maps illustrating social and geographic distribution, a summary of data from
                        the questionnaires, the <em class="citetitle">DARE</em> questionnaire, and an

                           representative works, and they encompass the well-known as well as the

                              bibliography of more than 11,000 separately published autobiographies
                              (through 1980) of American citizens and foreigners resident for an
                              appreciable time in the United States. Kaplan excludes Indian
                              captivity, travel, and slave narratives; journals; diaries;
                              collections of letters; manuscripts; genealogical works; fiction; and
                              general reminiscences. Briscoe, however, broadens the scope to admit
                              published memoirs, journals, diaries, and nonfiction works that
                              include substantial autobiographical material. Briscoe also includes
                              reprints of autobiographies published before 1945 as well as some
                              works omitted in Kaplan. Kaplan cites the most convenient edition;
                              Briscoe typically refers to the first edition. Entries, organized
                              alphabetically by author, include birth date (and death date in
                              Briscoe), title, publication information, pagination, location of one
                              copy (only in Kaplan), and annotation. Kaplan’s annotations rarely
                              extend beyond occupation and principal areas of residence, but
                              Briscoe’s are much fuller, typically offering an evaluative comment
                              and citing occupation, main focus, precise geographic locations, and
                              important persons and events. In Briscoe, an asterisk denotes a female
                              author. Both offer valuable subject indexes that cite occupations,
                              places, historical events, names, and ethnic and religious groups;
                              however, Briscoe’s index is more precise, detailed, and effectively
                              organized. Together, Kaplan and Briscoe list the majority of the
                              separately published autobiographies of American citizens and
                              long-time foreign residents.</p><p class="annotation">Additional separately published autobiographical
