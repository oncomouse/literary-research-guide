                           literature and culture of the midwestern states (Illinois, Indiana, Iowa,
                           Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, Wisconsin, and the eastern part of
                           Kansas, Nebraska, and the Dakotas) and of about 150 authors whose works
                           reflect the cultural life of the region. Entries are organized in two
                           divisions: subjects and individual authors. The first grouping consists
                           of extensively classified subdivisions listing primarily books on
                           literature and language, history and society, folklore, personal
                           narratives, architecture and graphics, Chicago, black literature,
                           Indians, and literary periodicals. Each subdivision is preceded by a
                           helpful evaluative overview of scholarship; most entries are succinctly
                           and clearly annotated. Each author bibliography consists of a headnote
                           that briefly comments on the writer’s stature, notes important studies,
                           suggests topics for research, and identifies major manuscript
                           collections; a chronological list of major primary works; and a
                           selective, unannotated list of scholarship. Two appendixes: brief
                           biographical notes on an additional 101 writers; a list of 101 fictional
                           narratives on the Midwest by writers not associated with the region.
                           Individual bibliographies are uneven in quality; the lack of
                           cross-references in the first part and the failure to provide a subject
                           index substantially reduce usability; articles are generally excluded
                           from the subject lists; and major writers are more adequately treated in
                           separate author bibliographies; even so, the usually judicious selection
                           and evaluative comments in the headnotes make Nemanic the first source to
                           consult in the study of midwestern literature generally and minor writers
                           associated with the region. Reviews: Craig S. Abbott,

                           South). Entries are listed alphabetically by thesis or dissertation
                           author in three classified divisions: individual writers; cultural,
                           historical, and social background (with sections for general studies,
                           folklore, education, theater, libraries and lyceums, onomastics,
                           language, and southern culture through others’ eyes); and general

                           authors or works discussed. Since a thesis or dissertation is listed only
                           once, the lack of cross-references and an index seriously mars the

                           English.</p><p class="annotation">The supplement is more closely restricted to
                           literary studies and omits foreign theses and dissertations. Its
                           approximately 3,000 entries are listed alphabetically by author in 13
                           divisions: individual authors, multiple author studies, general culture,
                           education, folklore, history, journalism, libraries, linguistics, music,
                           politics, religion, and speech and theater. Only the first division is
                           classified and includes cross-references for multiple-author studies.
                           Except for the omission of department, entries include the same

                           trans-Mississippi western literature and authors (including a few major
                           nonfiction writers), as well as outsiders who have written on the area or
                           influenced its literature. It is limited to important scholarship
                           (largely in English through 1994) and emphasizes recent studies; the
                           second edition omits master’s theses and several briefer or outdated
                           items included in the original edition (by Etulain [Lincoln: U of
                           Nebraska P, 1982; 317 pp.]). Coverage is especially selective for major
                           authors such as Cooper, Cather, Clemens, and Steinbeck. The 6,494 entries
                           are listed alphabetically in five divisions: bibliographies and reference
                           works, anthologies, general works (unhelpfully divided into books and
                           dissertations, and articles—special issues of journals unaccountably
                           appear in both sections), special topics (local color and regionalism,
                           dime novels and the western, film, Indian literature and Indians in
                           western literature, Mexican American literature and Chicanos in western
                           literature, the environment and western literature, women and families in
                           western literature, the Beats, and Canadian western literature), and
                           individual authors. A very few entries are briefly annotated. Indexed by
                           scholars. The lack of cross-references and subject indexing means that
                           researchers looking for studies on a writer must skim the divisions on
                           general works and special topics. Although several authors are more fully
                           covered in separate author bibliographies, <em class="citetitle">Bibliographical
                              Guide to the Study of Western American Literature</em> is the
                           essential starting point for research on the region.</p><p class="annotation">Because coverage is selective (indeed, there are
                           some inexplicable omissions), the guide must be supplemented with “Annual
                           Bibliography of Studies in Western American Literature” (<a class="link" href="ch17s02.xhtml#Q3665" title="Q3665">Q3665</a>),

                           456 pp.), is virtually useless: the criteria governing selection are
                           impossibly vague (“earlier major studies as well as . . .
                           recent burgeoning scholarship”); there are significant omissions in the
                           section on bibliographies and reference works; the division on literature
                           and theater is utterly inadequate, and coverage of individual authors is
                           erratic and incomplete (e.g., the 366 entries include 6 on Willa Cather);
                           and there is no subject indexing. If the divisions on reference works and
                           literature are representative, <em class="citetitle">American West in the Twentieth
                              Century</em> can hardly claim to be “the most comprehensive
                           bibliography now available on the history and culture of the
                           twentieth-century West.”</p></section></section></section></section></section></section><footer><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table style="width: 100%; "><tr><td style="width: 40%; text-align: left; "><a accesskey="p" href="ch17.xhtml">Prev</a> </td><td style="width: 20%; text-align: center; "><a accesskey="u" href="ch17.xhtml">Up</a></td><td style="width: 40%; text-align: right; "> <a accesskey="n" href="ch17s03.xhtml">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 40%; text-align: left; vertical-align: top; ">Chapter 17. American Literature </td><td style="width: 20%; text-align: center; "><a accesskey="h" href="index.xhtml">Home</a></td><td style="width: 40%; text-align: right; vertical-align: top; "> Ethnic and Minority Literatures</td></tr></table></div></footer></body></html>
