                        literary history by “expanding the canon, forging new critical perspectives,
                        and scrutinizing underlying cultural and ideological assumptions” through a
                        focus on African American, American Indian, Asian American, Chicano, and
                        Puerto Rican literature. The essays are organized in three divisions:
                        discussions of “various ways of redefining the American literary canon and
                        its relation to the literatures of minorities and white women”; the oral
                        dimensions of American literature; critical and historical perspectives.
                        Following the essays are selected, annotated bibliographies through
                        1989—with sections for bibliographies, anthologies, primary works, general
                        criticism, and major authors—of multiethnic, African American, American

                        an index hampers access, and some of the essays originally prepared for a
                        1981 convention do not reflect the debate over and changes in the canon

                        historical works, sermons, folk literature, spirituals, journalism, and
                        pamphlets. Although the discussions of both major and lesser-known writers
                        favor the biographical and historical, few works escape stringent
                        evaluation. Vol. 1 concludes with a valuable bibliographical essay that
                        evaluates general historical studies, literary histories, critical books,
                        and anthologies. Indexed by persons, literary forms, and titles of anonymous
                        works. A balanced, thorough account of the development of African American
                        literature that stresses racial protest as its common factor, vol. 1 set a
                        high standard for a work that would have filled a major void in the history
                        of literatures of the United States and promised to become the standard work

                        American women writers. Coverage extends to “poetry, memoirs, biographies,
                        criticisms, autobiographies, essays, short fiction, novels, diaries and
                        journals” written between 1746 and 1991. Entries are organized in three
                        divisions: individual authors; anthologies; general works. In the first,
                        authors are listed alphabetically; under each are sections for primary works
                        and for studies (the former listed alphabetically by title and the latter by
                        author), and some sections are followed by “1988–1991 Supplement,” the
                        inconsistent placement of which is decidedly confusing (e.g., the additional
                        list of works by an author sometimes follows the primary works section and
                        sometimes follows the secondary works section). In addition, the separate
                        “Supplement: Additional Writers and Sources, 1988–1991” follows the
                        general-works division. Coverage of primary works seems much fuller than
                        that of studies, especially for post-1987 publications (e.g., “1988–1991
                        Supplement” under Toni Morrison lists only 20 works about her). The
                        inexcusably haphazard organization, failure to include names in running
                        heads, and poorly designed index make this book needlessly difficult to use.
                        And the numerous omissions—especially in the coverage of critical
                        studies—unfortunately render it untrustworthy.</p></section></section><section class="section" id="Q3725"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title">Q3725</h5></div></div></div><section class="section" id="Q3725c"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6 class="title"/></div></div></div><p id="Q3725c1" class="citation">Kallenbach, Jessamine S.,

                           (regrettably not indexing references to writers in divisions other than

                           indexing mean that users searching for single-author studies must skim
                           all entries. These shortcomings, together with the lack of clarity about
                           criteria governing the selection of both primary and secondary works and
                           the exclusion of most foreign scholarship, render <em class="citetitle">Harlem

                                 first-line, and last-line entries, which are in turn keyed to the

                           Canada. The 3,695 entries are organized alphabetically by author in 16
                           divisions. The first four are devoted to general topics: bibliography,
                           autobiography (both primary and secondary works), general literature
                           (with sections for collections and anthologies, general studies of Indian
                           authors, types of Indian literature, and general studies of Indian
                           literature), and language (with sections for general studies;
                           lexicography, grammar, and morphology; language classification;
                           glottochronology and lexicostatistics; language and culture; linguists,
                           collecting, recording, and transcribing; interrelationships of Indian
                           languages and their relationships to other languages; sign language). The
                           remaining divisions are devoted to regions, each with sections for
                           literature, language, and tribal groups; under the last heading are
                           separate alphabetical lists for literature and language. An asterisk
                           denotes an important work. Because of the overlapping of regions and
                           tribal groups, users should check the index to locate studies of a
                           particular tribe. Indexed by authors, tribal groups, and subjects, but
                           because of the organization, the subject indexing does not provide
                           adequate access to the entries. Although selective, dated, and
                           emphasizing written literature, this work remains the best general guide
                           to research before 1977 on Indian languages and literatures. Review:

                              lists of titles and authors (alphabetized according to
                              English-language conventions) are keyed to the other three indexes;

                              the 1999 Knopf edition and a 1994 Spanish translation; the German,

                              editions are not included); the practice of listing translations
                              separately with virtually the same annotation wastes space. The
                              autobiographies and biographies list is something of a hodgepodge that

                        1970s. The 3,291 entries are organized in four divisions: general works
                        (with sections for bibliographies, biographical sources, indexes, library
                        and manuscript collections, literary history, general criticism, and
                        anthologies), poets, fiction writers, and dramatists (with sections for
                        reference works and criticism and theater history). Each division or section
                        has separate lists for American and Canadian literature and writers. Under
                        each author are lists of bibliographies, primary works (chronologically by
                        genre), and criticism. Appendix A is devoted to Yiddish literature in
                        English translation, appendix B to a list of other Jewish writers. The
                        descriptive annotations are brief but generally adequate; however, many
                        entries are not annotated. Three indexes: authors; titles; subjects. Users
                        should note that some writers appear under more than one genre. Although
                        marred by an inadequate explanation of scope and the failure to index
                        authors and topics mentioned in annotations to the first division, this work
                        offers the fullest single guide to North American Jewish writers. Many
                        studies of American and Canadian Jewish literature can be identified through
                        the headings beginning with “Jewish” in the subject index to post-1980
                        volumes of <em class="citetitle">MLAIB</em> (<a class="link" href="ch07s02.html#G335" title="G335">G335</a>) or in the online thesaurus.</p><p class="annotation">Additional English-language studies of and works by

                        have been culled from standard databases and indexes, and the excessive
                        number of pages needlessly consumed by annotations of book reviews (while
                        dissertations and general studies are listed without comment) should instead
                        be devoted to an index.</p></section></section></section></section></section><footer><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table style="width: 100%; "><tr><td style="width: 40%; text-align: left; "><a accesskey="p" href="ch17s02.html">Prev</a> </td><td style="width: 20%; text-align: center; "><a accesskey="u" href="ch17.html">Up</a></td><td style="width: 40%; text-align: right; "> <a accesskey="n" href="ch17s04.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 40%; text-align: left; vertical-align: top; ">Regional Literature </td><td style="width: 20%; text-align: center; "><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td style="width: 40%; text-align: right; vertical-align: top; "> Early American Literature (to 1800)</td></tr></table></div></footer></body></html>
