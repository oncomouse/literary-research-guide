                     the scholar working with literature of the early republic (1790–1860).
                     Following an admirably clear explanation of the basics of online searching are
                     chapters on general literary reference sources (including some devoted to
                     individual writers); library catalogs; print and electronic bibliographies,
                     indexes, and annual reviews (again, with some devoted to individual writers);
                     scholarly journals; contemporary reviews and literary magazines; contemporary
                     journals and newspapers; microform and digital collections; manuscripts and
                     archives; and Web resources. The last two chapters demonstrate how to use many
                     of the works and strategies previously discussed to develop a research plan and
                     address how to find definitions of terms (using “nationalism” as an example).
                     An appendix lists sources in related disciplines. Indexed by titles and
                     subjects. Describing fully the uses of kinds of reference tools, providing
                     illuminating examples in discussions of key individual resources, detailing
                     techniques for finding kinds of information (including primary works), and
                     illustrating research processes, <em class="citetitle">Literary Research and the Era of

                     several bibliographies, <em class="citetitle">European Americana</em> includes in
                     vol. 1 many literary and other works with only incidental references to the

                     alphabetically within each year by author, corporate author, or title of
                     anonymous work, entries provide title, imprint, final page number, format, a
                     note on American content if not clear from the title, references to standard
                     bibliographies, and locations. Users must remember that much information is
                     taken unverified from other sources and that titles and imprints are frequently
                     edited rather than exact transcriptions. Additions are printed in vol. 1, pp.
                     261–66, and vol. 2, pp. 526–27. Each volume has three indexes: geographic index
                     of printers and booksellers; alphabetical index of printers and booksellers;
                     authors, titles, and subjects. The Alden-Landis <em class="citetitle">European

                           date. Particularly vexing is Evans’s practice of supplying descriptive
                           titles based on advertisements. Although Evans does not identify
                           secondhand entries, Shipton encloses within brackets titles not seen or
                           “described by a careful bibliographer” and derives entries from

                        Although journal articles, theses, and dissertations are included, selection
                        is limited to holdings of the Library of Congress. The 14,810 entries are
                        organized alphabetically by author or title of anonymous work in most of the
                        12 extensively classified divisions: bibliographies and reference works
                        (with sections for subject bibliographies, catalogs of eighteenth-century
                        imprints, and guides to manuscript collections); general studies; the
                        British Empire and the American Revolution; the colonies on the eve of
                        independence; the West; the war, 1775–83; loyalists; diplomacy and other
                        international aspects of the Revolution; confederation and consolidation of
                        the Revolution; the Constitution, 1787–89; economic, social, and
                        intellectual life (with sections on printers, newspapers, books, and
                        libraries; literature; and fine arts); and biographical sources. Fewer than
                        40% of the entries are accompanied by descriptive annotations that
                        frequently cite related works. The work is indexed by names and some

                        Congress holdings and works published before 1973 results in the omission of
                        some important studies, especially in the sections related to literature,

                           are organized alphabetically by original title, with cross-references for
                           subtitles and later titles. The amount of detail varies depending on
                           available information, but a full entry cites title, date of first and
                           last issue, frequency, editor(s), publisher(s), and up to two locations.

                           highly selective in recording contents, it is nevertheless an important

                           1979 on poetry by American immigrants or transients born before 1680.
                           Excludes bibliographies and general literary histories. Following a
                           division for general and thematic studies, literary influences, and
                           aesthetics are sections for individual authors and almanacs; broadsides,
                           ballads, and anonymous verse; and elegies. Within each division, works
                           are listed by publication date under separate headings for books, shorter
                           writings (including parts of books), and dissertations. (As in other
                           early Hall Reference Guides, these headings are repeated even when no
                           book, shorter writing, or dissertation appears in a year.) Entries are
                           accompanied by full descriptive annotations. Although many works are
                           given multiple entries, users should consult the index to locate all
                           studies of a writer or type of verse. An asterisk marks the few works not
                           seen. The index of persons and selected topics is difficult to use
                           because of the abbreviations identifying the section in which an entry
                           appears. Despite the omission of bibliographies and general literary
                           histories, <em class="citetitle">Seventeenth-Century American Poetry</em> is
                           an essential compilation for identifying scholarship on early American
                           verse.</p></section></section><section class="section" id="idm101545498784"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6 class="title">See also</h6></div></div></div><p class="reference">Donow, <em class="citetitle">Sonnet in England and

                           most dissertations and foreign language studies. Entries are organized
                           alphabetically by author in five divisions: general studies and reference
                           works (with sections for printing and publishing, anthologies and

                           subjects. The guide is a useful starting place for research on early
                           prose, even though it is selective, lacks a clear explanation of criteria
                           governing selection, and is awkwardly organized (with many sections
