                     reissue[s] and other periodicals, pamphlets under 49 pages, specialized
                     publications of a transitory nature or intended as advertising, and most

                     Classification (with separate alphabetical lists of adult and juvenile
                     fiction). In addition to basic library catalog information, entries usually
                     list price and the address of an obscure publisher or distributor. Corrected
                     entries are substituted in the various cumulations, and the ones for 1950–77
                     and 1876–1981 add thousands of records taken from the

                        are listed alphabetically by author in seven divisions (some of which have
                        sections for general studies and individual periodicals): general studies,
                        New England, Middle Atlantic states, the South, the West, bibliographies and
                        checklists (including sections for some of the preceding divisions), and
                        background studies. Studies of literary materials in nonliterary periodicals
                        and of Poe and American literary periodicals are relegated to appendixes.
                        The work is flawed by a narrow focus, inadequate explanation of scope, and
                        inefficient organization, but it is a serviceable compilation of studies
                        that are sometimes difficult to locate in the standard serial bibliographies

                        indexed were printed in the United States. Users can search by keyword(s) in
                        all fields, document authors, or article titles. Searchers must try variant
                        forms of names in keyword searches (e.g., Robert Browning is indexed under
                        seven different forms of his name). Some records can be browsed by title,
                        author, or keyword (though the last will require scrolling through hundreds
                        of screens for words appearing near the end of the alphabet). Search results
                        are broken down by printed source, then by relevancy rank within each
                        source; results can be sorted (in ascending or descending order) by date,
                        author, title, language, or classification (though it is unclear what the
                        last entails). Although the content of a record is determined by its printed
                        source (and thus frequently lacks full bibliographical details), some
                        records have been enhanced. Records marked for downloading must first be
                        saved to a list. Although subject to most of the limitations of the sources
                        it reproduces and hampered by a primitive search interface, <em class="citetitle">19th

                        American periodicals published between 1802 and 1 January 1907. The
                        supplements provide current as well as retrospective coverage for
                        periodicals newly added. Although entries cite an abbreviated title, author
                        (with many unauthenticated attributions), periodical title, volume, and
                        initial page number, researchers accustomed to modern subject indexes will
                        find Poole’s a frustrating work to consult because (1) subject headings,
                        derived largely from title words, are capricious and inconsistent and offer
                        few cross-references to related headings; (2) the imposition of uniform
                        periodical titles and volume numbers that ignore title changes and a
                        publisher’s numbering system means that Dearing (see below) must be
                        consulted to locate many articles; (3) literary contributions are listed by
                        title; (4) reviews of literary works appear under the author of the work
                        reviewed, but reviews of nonfiction books appear under the subject of the
                        work; (5) the numerous attributions of unsigned articles must be
                        authenticated in more reliable sources. Some of these defects are remedied
                        in the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: none; "><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: none"><p class="list-item">Dearing, Vinton A. <em class="citetitle">Transfer Vectors for

                              periodicals, this work is essential for ascertaining the actual

                           for copyright between 1870 and 1916. Works are listed alphabetically by
                           title, with cross-references for alternative titles or subtitles. Because
                           of changes in copyright law, entries vary in content but typically record
                           (when appropriate) title; author; translator; copyright claimant; and
                           date of registration, publication, and deposit of copy. (Users should
                           study the explanation of the sample entries on pp. iii–iv.) Plays
                           registered during part of 1915 and all of 1916, along with additions and
                           corrections, appear in a supplementary list (vol. 2, pp. 2,659–833).
                           Indexed by persons (with titles following each name). Copies of about
                           20,000 works registered before 1 July 1909 were never deposited; however,
                              <em class="citetitle">Dramatic Compositions</em> is an underutilized but
                           indispensable record of plays that were copyrighted in the United States.
                           Since some deposit copies—many of which are unpublished manuscripts or
                           printed acting copies—are held by the Library of Congress, the work also
                           serves as a valuable source for locating otherwise unobtainable
                           materials. Researchers should note that printed copies selected for the
                           Library of Congress collection are included in the library’s online
                           catalog; other printed copies and manuscripts must be located by
                           consulting the card file in the Copyright Office Public Record Reading
                           Room. After obtaining the copyright registration number for an
                           unpublished manuscript or typescript, researchers may consult microfilm
                           copies of many of the deposits for this period in the Manuscript Reading
                           Room. Some notes about prefilming transfers of certain twentieth-century
                           scripts may be found in the Manuscript Division’s evolving, internal
                           finding aid for selected plays from the Copyright Deposit Drama

                           alphabetically by author in two divisions: general studies and major
                           authors. The first has sections for bibliographies, indexes, library and
                           microform collections, anthologies and collections, general histories,
                           and history and criticism (with the last organized by period and
                           including studies of minor authors and anonymous plays). Each of the 34
                           important playwrights (most of whom date from the nineteenth century) has
                           separate lists of editions, nondramatic works, bibliographies,

                           users to related studies. The generally brief descriptive annotations are
                           uneven, with many failing to convey a sense of content. Three indexes:
                           persons; titles; subjects. Although selective and lacking an adequate

                           best preliminary guide to studies of American drama before 1900 and is
