                     Following an admirably clear explanation of the basics of online searching are
                     chapters on general literary reference sources; library catalogs; print and
                     electronic bibliographies, indexes, and annual reviews; scholarly journals;
                     contemporary reviews; newspapers, little magazines, and microforms; manuscripts
                     and archives; and Web resources. (Many of the preceding chapters discuss works
                     devoted to individual authors.) The last chapter demonstrates how to use many
                     of the works and strategies previously discussed to develop a research plan. An
                     appendix lists sources in related disciplines. Indexed by titles and subjects

                        not provide full publication information for articles. These authoritative
                        surveys remain indispensable for their winnowing of pre-1986 scholarship.

                           critical attention. Entries are organized in two divisions: general works

                           critical studies), general works on the novel (with sections for history
                           and criticism, types, themes, and regionalism), studies of the short
                           story, and collections of interviews. Individual authors are treated in
                           essays, with sections for bibliographies and manuscripts, primary works,
                           editions and reprints, biographical studies, and criticism. The

                              the 4,214 entries are organized in two divisions: general studies of

                              America but also in Great Britain, the Federal Republic of Germany,
                              and a few other countries. Most reviews of individual productions are
                              excluded. The approximately 3,600 entries are organized by publication
                              date in five classified divisions: general reference works (with
                              sections for encyclopedias and guides, review and song indexes,
                              bibliographies, yearbooks, and discographies); stage musical in North
                              America (predecessors, history and development, elements of the
                              musical [such as music and dance], production, and public reception);
                              stage musical in other countries (Great Britain, Federal Republic of
                              Germany and Austria, socialist countries, and other countries); film
                              musical (general studies, essays and short criticism, special effects,
                              adaptations of stage musicals, and dance); and people (general

                              choreographers, and producers; performers). The subtitle is
                              misleading, since only about one-fourth of the entries are accompanied
                              by descriptive annotations, a few of which incorporate an evaluative
                              comment; none of the entries in the people divisions is annotated. Two
                              indexes: scholars; subjects and titles of musicals. Despite the
                              incomplete annotation, this work provides the fullest list of
                              scholarship on the musical and is especially valuable for its

                           endeavors “to recognize major voices and to bring many other poets into
                           our conversations about modern poetry.” Focused on recovering American
                           poets who have fallen outside the literary canon, Nelson explains that
                           recovery in this setting is necessarily theorized in complex social and
                           historical contexts. Part 1, the opening chapter, introduces the century
                           of poetry and weaves strands among entries to create a cohesive whole
                           made of diverse parts. The chapters that follow have been arranged in
                           logical and complementary order. Part 2, the main body of the text,
                           covers movements, genres, and theories such as modernism, sentimentality,
                           poetry and labor, poetry and music, surrealism, psychoanalysis, political
                           poetry, and disability poetics and topics such as American Indian poetry,
                           women, economics and gender, American culture, war, African American
                           poetry, Asian American poetry, religion, news, diaspora, environmental

                           dissertations, theses, and parts of books through 1984. The 267 entries
                           are listed in two divisions: multiple-author bibliographies (organized
                           alphabetically by compiler or editor and including bibliographies of

                           date under each author). The annotations offer a clear description of
                           scope and (usually) a succinct evaluation of a work’s utility or quality.
                           The introduction provides an overview of the bibliography of contemporary

                           English-language studies (published through 1978, but with some additions
                           through 1981) on contemporary British and American poetry. The
                           approximately 100 poets (two-thirds of them American) are selected on the
                           basis of having been the subject of a reasonable amount of criticism,
                           although writers who appear in other volumes in the series are excluded.
                           The studies included seem to represent what the compiler found in
                           standard bibliographies and indexes. The descriptively annotated entries
                           are organized alphabetically in eight divisions: bibliographies and
                           reference works, contemporary culture and sociology, general aesthetics
                           and poetic theory, general studies of poetry and poets, general studies
                           of American poets and literature, general studies of British poets and
                           literature, studies of two or more poets, and individual authors (each
                           with sections, when needed, for books of poetry, bibliographies,
                           biographies, books about, and articles about). Users must consult
                           existing author bibliographies, since Gingerich supplements but does not
                           duplicate listings in them, and use the name index to locate general
                           studies that discuss an author, since there are no cross-references. Two
                           indexes: names; titles of works cited. The considerable gaps in coverage
                           and lack of a subject index leave this work far short of the sorely
                           needed bibliography of scholarship and criticism on contemporary poetry.
                           It is, however, far superior to Phillis Gershator, <em class="citetitle">A
