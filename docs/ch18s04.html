                     Following an admirably clear explanation of the basics of online searching are
                     chapters on general literary reference sources; library catalogs; print and

                     newspapers; microform and digital collections; manuscripts and archives; and
                     Web resources. The last chapter demonstrates how to use many of the works and
                     strategies previously discussed to develop a research plan (with Aboriginal
                     Australian literature serving as an example). An appendix lists sources in

                        digitized newspapers, recent theses, archived Web sites, as well as
                        manuscript and archival material. The site absorbed the records from

                           (<em class="citetitle">RAAM</em>), a union register of manuscript collections
                        and individual manuscripts held by Australian libraries and archives. The
                        register covered collections (including those not directly related to
                        Australia), individual manuscripts of primary material, photocopies or
                        microfilms of documents related to the continent, and personal papers in
                        government archives; it excluded unpublished copies of secondary material
                        (e.g., conference papers or theses), media, microfilms or photocopies of
                        non-Australian material, and government records. The Diaries, Letters, and

                        variety of printed and other sources as well as from information submitted
                        by repositories, individual records vary in amount of information and extent
                        of description; the same is true of records created in

                           1976 (although a few later publications are admitted). Entries are
                           organized in four classified divisions: general works (with sections for

                           photographs) that depict the history of the Australian stage to 1980. The
                           emphasis is on Australian drama professionally produced in Sydney and
                           Melbourne, with less attention to foreign language, amateur, and
                           educational theater and excluding opera, film, and television. The heart
                           of the work is the extensive extracts, which describe productions of both
                           Australian and foreign plays. The extracts are organized chronologically
                           in four periods (1788–1853, 1854–1900, 1901–50, and 1950–80), followed by
                           a section reproducing pictorial documents depicting productions,
                           theaters, sets, and performers. Each period begins with a summary of
                           theatrical activity and includes one or two essays on aspects of the
                           theater of the time (e.g., theater of the convict era, dramatic criticism
                           from 1850 to 1890, Australian plays on Australian topics, vaudeville,
                           state theater companies, and alternative theater). Most essays conclude
                           with an evaluative guide to further reading, and the last section of the
                           book is an extensive bibliography of studies of Australian theater.
                           Indexed by persons, titles, and subjects. Valuable for its extensive
