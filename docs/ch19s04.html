                     aspects of the Greco-Latin world to c. AD 800. Entries are organized in two
                     parts: authors and anonymous works; subjects. Under each author or anonymous
                     work are separate lists of bibliographies, collections of essays, editions, and
                     studies. The second part consists of 10 variously classified divisions:
                     literary history (with sections for general works, literary theory, and
                     genres); linguistics (with sections for general works, specific languages,
                     onomastics, and metrics); history of texts (including paleography and textual
                     criticism); nonliterary sources (with sections for archeology, epigraphy,
                     numismatics, and papyrology); history; law; philosophy and history of ideas;
                     science and technology; the study of the classics; and collections of essays.
                     Entries are accompanied by descriptive annotations (predominantly in French but
                     also in English, Italian, and German) and citations to reviews. The type and
                     number of indexes vary, with recent volumes providing five: subject headings;
                     names from antiquity; names of authors and others since the Middle Ages;
                     places; scholars. The international scope and impressive degree of coverage
                     make this the indispensable guide to scholarship on Greek and Latin language

                     languages but exclude dissertations. Entries are listed alphabetically by

                     The lack of cross-references means that users must consult the index to locate
                     all listed works on a literary author or anonymous work. A few entries are
