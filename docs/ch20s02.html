                     books usually omit subtitles; those for articles, page numbers. Users must
                     remember that (1) coverage varies considerably from section to section (e.g.,
                     the treatment of genres, literary theory, and Asian and East European
                     literatures is especially weak; in many sections, selection seems arbitrary);
                     (2) because the classification is heavily dependent on titles, works are
                     frequently inappropriately classified; (3) influence studies are listed under
                     the influencer; (4) effective use requires close familiarity with the
                     classification system outlined on pp. v–x. The lack of any index or sufficient
                     cross-references, the classification practices, and inconsistencies mean that
                     users must exercise considerable ingenuity to track down studies (and will
                     usually end up searching entry by entry through several sections). Although it
                     lacks an adequate explanation of scope, limitations, and principles of
                     organization and selection; omits many important works; and is frustrating to
                     use because of its classification practices and lack of indexing, the work
                     remains the most complete bibliography of comparative scholarship before 1950.
