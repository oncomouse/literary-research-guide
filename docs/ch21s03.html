                     <em class="citetitle">Second edition</em> (1926–62). The second edition lists about
                     75,000 titles from 1475 through 1949 and includes some works of unattributed
                     authorship. Entries, listed alphabetically by title, cite attributed author,
                     format, pagination, source of the entry, and place and date of publication. Two
                     indexes in vols. 7–9: authors; initials and pseudonyms. Locating an entry is
                     usually time-consuming, since the indexes cite volume and page and researchers
                     must hunt through a title entry to find a name or initials. Users should keep
                     several points in mind: (1) because many entries are taken from other
                     sources—especially the <em class="citetitle">
                        <span class="roman">British Museum</span> General Catalogue of

                        (<a class="link" href="ch13.xhtml#M1425a">M1425a</a>), both notoriously
                     inaccurate in attributing authorship—there are numerous errors in transcription
                     of titles (thus making impossible the location of some works) and
                     identification of authorship, and works that are not truly anonymous are
                     included; (2) although the source of an entry is usually recorded, evidence for
                     attribution is not; thus, there is no immediate way of assessing the accuracy
                     of an ascription; (3) because of the organization, books published between 1475
                     and 1900 are included in vols. 1–6 as well as the supplements in vols. 6, 7,
                     and 9, and books published between 1900 and 1949 are in vols. 8 and 9. Although
                     incomplete, inaccurate, and time-consuming to use, Halkett and Laing remains an
                     essential, if untrustworthy, source for identifying the author of an anonymous
                     or pseudonymous publication. It is partly superseded by the much improved third
                     edition. For a history of the first and second editions, see the preface to
                     vol. 1 of the third edition.</p><p class="annotation">

                        1475–1700</em>—is limited to separately published English-language
                     works (including translations and bilingual or multilingual publications with a
                     substantial portion in English) that appeared anonymously or pseudonymously
                     between 1475 and 1700 and for which authorship has been established or
                     ascribed. It excludes works falsely attributed or unattributed, although
                     exceptions are made for any works listed in the second edition.</p><p class="annotation">The new edition is a major improvement over its
                     predecessor: along with defining scope more precisely, adding numerous works,
                     correcting many errors, and basing descriptions on the actual examination of
                     copies, the third edition records the evidence and its source for attributions,
                     along with title, place and date of publication, and references to standard
                     bibliographies. Editorial practices are clearly and fully explained in the
                     introduction (pp. xxii–xliv) to vol. 1. Additions and corrections to vol. 1
                     appear on p. 221. Indexed by writers’ names, with a list of pseudonyms keyed to
                     the index; in addition, vol. 1 prints useful concordances for entry numbers in
