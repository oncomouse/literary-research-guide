            one author bibliography. Because of their number, wide variation in quality, and ease of
            identification (in library catalogs, bibliographies of bibliographies, and serial
            bibliographies and indexes), individual author bibliographies are not listed in this
               <em class="citetitle">Guide</em>. (For a convenient list of separately published author
            bibliographies, consult Bracken, <em class="citetitle">Reference Works in British and American
               Literature</em> [<a class="link" href="ch13.xhtml#M1357" title="M1357">M1357</a>].)</p><p class="annotation">Although it is generally the best place to begin extensive research
            on an author or specific work, an author bibliography, like any other reference work,
            must be used with due regard for its scope, limitations, and accuracy. As I point out in
               <em class="citetitle">On Compiling an Annotated Bibliography</em> (<a class="link" href="ch01s02.xhtml#A30" title="A30">A30</a>):</p><p class="extract">Several of these bibliographies are models of their kind: intelligent,
            accurate, thorough, efficiently organized works that foster scholarship by guiding
            readers through accumulated studies as well as implicitly or explicitly isolating
            dominant scholarly concerns, identifying topics that have been overworked, and
            suggesting needed research. Unfortunately, many are flawed in either conception or
            execution, and some are downright shoddy. (1)</p><p class="annotation">Before searching out entries, users must study the prefatory
            explanation of scope and organization, become familiar with the index(es), and assess
            the accuracy of the work. A good bibliography will begin with a precise statement of
            what it includes and excludes, its chronological span, organization and content of
            entries, and relationship to other bibliographies. (Because many bibliographies are
            inexcusably vague about some or all of these matters, researchers will have no immediate
            way of determining how complete a work is.) An efficient, effective search of an author
            bibliography requires an understanding of the organization of entries and the nature of
            the index(es). For example, when searching for scholarship on a specific work in an
            author bibliography with sections for individual literary works, it is essential to know
            whether general studies are cross-referenced, accorded multiple listings, or accessible
            only through an index. Because judging accuracy is best accomplished through repeated
            use, researchers consulting a bibliography for the first time should search out reviews;
            unfortunately, too few author bibliographies are subjected to rigorous reviewing.</p><p class="annotation">Because no bibliography is comprehensive and every one is outdated
            even before the last keystroke of the final draft is saved, researchers will also have
            to consult appropriate serial bibliographies and indexes listed throughout this
               <em class="citetitle">Guide</em>.</p></section><footer><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table style="width: 100%; "><tr><td style="width: 40%; text-align: left; "><a accesskey="p" href="ch21s04.xhtml">Prev</a> </td><td style="width: 20%; text-align: center; "><a accesskey="u" href="ch21.xhtml">Up</a></td><td style="width: 40%; text-align: right; "> <a accesskey="n" href="ch21s06.xhtml">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 40%; text-align: left; vertical-align: top; ">Art and Literature </td><td style="width: 20%; text-align: center; "><a accesskey="h" href="index.xhtml">Home</a></td><td style="width: 40%; text-align: right; vertical-align: top; "> Bibliography and Textual Criticism</td></tr></table></div></footer></body></html>
