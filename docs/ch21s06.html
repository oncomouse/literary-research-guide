                     consists of a history of book production organized in two extensively
                     illustrated divisions: the handpress period (1500–1800) and the machine press
                     period (1800–1950). The first discusses the technical details of printing type,
                     composition, paper, imposition, presswork, the warehouse, binding, decoration
                     and illustration, patterns of production, and the English book trade; the
                     second, plates, type from 1800 to 1875, paper, edition binding, printing

                     to 1950, printing practices, and the book trade in Britain and America.
                     Following the history is a too-brief section on bibliographical applications:
                     the identification of edition, impression, issue, and state; bibliographical
                     description (with sample descriptions printed as an appendix); and textual
                     bibliography (with two analyses of transmission of texts in an appendix).
                     Another appendix reprints Ronald McKerrow’s discussion of Elizabethan
                     handwriting (see below). Concludes with a useful, but now dated, selected
                     bibliography that evaluates important scholarship through the early 1970s.
                     Thoroughly indexed by persons and subjects. Although it is better in its

                     period, inadequate in its attention to analytical bibliography and
                     demonstration of the applications of physical bibliography to the transmission
                     of texts, and densely written in many places, this work provides the best basic

                     twentieth-century Anglo-American textual and bibliographical scholarship.
                     Chapters discuss analytical bibliography, descriptive bibliography,
                     transmission of texts, and textual criticism; a selective bibliography
                     concludes the work. Particularly informative are the description of the process
                     of preparing a critical edition and the appendix on textual notation, a
                     convenient guide for readers puzzled by the symbols and lists in the editorial
                     apparatus of a critical edition. Although not a substitute for Gaskell,

                     The 12 chapters provide exacting, detailed treatment of the nature of
                     descriptive bibliography; edition, issue, and state and ideal copy in the
                     handpress period; the bibliographical description of books of the sixteenth

                     features; format and collation formula; reference notation; statement of
                     signing, pagination and foliation, and other elements of a description; special

                     and the description of nineteenth- and twentieth-century books. Three important
                     appendixes conclude the work: a digest of the collation and pagination or

                     prose, and fiction—are effectively chosen to illustrate the kinds of problems
                     that confront an editor and to show that each textual situation is unique. For
                     each example, Gaskell characterizes the surviving forms and their relationship,
                     discusses the choice of copy-text, proposes emendations, and suggests an

                     documents, especially unpublished materials such as letters, journals, diaries,

                     critical editing, chapters proceed more or less in order of the tasks facing an
                     editor: organizing a project; locating, collecting, and organizing materials;
                     maintaining records; determining the scope and organization of an edition;
                     evaluating and transcribing the source text; deciding on the presentation of
                     the text, with discussions of type facsimiles, diplomatic transcriptions,
                     electronic publication, and inclusive, expanded, and clear texts; using
                     editorial symbols (for interlineations, deletions, and the like, with a helpful
                     list on pp. 153–58 of symbols that have been employed) and writing textual
                     notes; understanding general rules and their exceptions, emending the text, and
                     handling variant forms of a document; dealing with the mechanics of
                     establishing a text; preparing an edition for the printer (including writing
                     annotations, indexing, and drafting a statement of editorial method); and
                     handling relations with the publisher (with attention to electronic
                     publication). Each chapter concludes with a helpful list of suggested readings;
                     current lists, discussions of new technological advances, and additional
                     examples of editorial techniques can be found on the Web site. An appendix
                     prints sample inquiries addressed to librarians, booksellers, and auction
                     houses. Based on a solid command of editorial theory and extensive familiarity
                     with related scholarship and published editions, this work combines theory and

                     Successive chapters draw on a wide range of examples from British and American
                     literature to examine basic principles of textual criticism: the aesthetics of
                     textual criticism (favoring the argument that textual criticism is a system of
                     perfectible details rather than a science); the ideal of textual criticism (“to
                     present the text which the author intended”); the province of textual criticism
                     (especially its relations to bibliography); the basic principles of textual
                     analysis; the treatment of accidentals; and the establishment of the text.

                        continued for 1971–85 in Feather’s supplement. Under each author or subject,
                           <em class="citetitle">1933–1970</em> lists entries alphabetically by journal,
                        then chronologically by publication date; Feather lists entries
                        alphabetically by title under author heads, by author under subject heads.
                        Because <em class="citetitle">1933–1970</em> is derived from a Bodleian Library
                        card index that was compiled over several years by various persons, there
                        are numerous errors in transcriptions, oversights (e.g., an entire volume of
                           <em class="citetitle">Library</em> was omitted, although it is indexed in
                        Barr’s addenda), and inconsistencies in subject headings. Subject indexing
                        is frequently superficial or inaccurate because of the reliance on title
                        keywords. Feather offers superior subject indexing but unaccountably fails
                        to continue coverage of <em class="citetitle">Studies in Bibliography</em> and
                           <em class="citetitle">Papers of the Bibliographical Society of
                        America</em>—two of the most important bibliographical journals—or to
                        replace journals no longer published with <em class="citetitle">AEB: Analytical and
                           Enumerative Bibliography</em> or <em class="citetitle">TEXT: An

                        untrustworthiness of <em class="citetitle">1933–1970</em>, the failure to index
                        volumes published in 1970, and the unacceptable reduction in coverage
                        offered by <em class="citetitle">1971–1985</em> underscore Feather’s prefatory
                        remark that “bibliography has not been well served by indexers.” Indeed, it
                        is unfortunate to have to say that <em class="citetitle">1933–1970</em>, Barr’s
                        addenda, and Feather constitute the single best index to this body of
                        publications. They must, however, be supplemented by the serial
