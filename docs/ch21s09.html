                        (1976; 304 pp.). Chapters by leading scholars examine rhetorical invention;
                        structure and form in nonnarrative prose; approaches to the study of style;
                        aims, modes, and forms of discourse; tests of writing ability; basic
                        writing; language varieties and composition; literacy, linguistics, and

                        literature; writing across the curriculum; and computers and composition.
                        The essays vary considerably in organization, rigor of assessment, and
                        scope, with some authors merely updating rather than revising their original

                        should generally approach the work through the subject index. As Tate points

                        both are important overviews of early research in rhetoric and composition.
                        In general, Moran and Lunsford is more effectively organized and thorough

                        includes the bibliography. The taxonomy has changed considerably over the
                        years (most notably with vols. 18 [1984], 26.2 [1992], 31.2 [1997], 38.2
                        [2003], and 44.2 [2009]); entries are currently organized in divisions for

                        literary response, literature, or narrative; media literacy or use;

                        reading; second-language literacy; and writing. These titles, however, as
                        well as the scope of the bibliography, are prone to change without notice or
                        explanation. Beginning with 38.2 (2003), the annotated entries in each
                        division are followed by an unannotated list headed Other Related Research.
                        Since 45.2 (2010), annotated entries include keyword tags to facilitate
                        searching; see the introduction to the first PDF-only version for an
                        explanation of the tags. Until 26.2 (1992), many of the descriptive
                        annotations are too brief to offer an adequate sense of content. Although
                        coverage of books and articles is not especially thorough (in some issues

                              with annual cumulation. (Former title: <em class="citetitle">Office of Education
                                 Research Reports, [1956–65]</em>, 1967.) An index to books,
                              dissertations, theses, audiovisual materials, computer programs, and a
                              variety of unpublished materials such as conference papers, research
                              reports, and curriculum guides—in short, material on education not
                              indexed in <em class="citetitle">CIJE</em>. Organized like
                                 <em class="citetitle">CIJE</em>, entries include
                                 <em class="citetitle">ERIC</em> document number, bibliographical

                              and abstract. Four indexes: subject; author; institution; and document
                              type. Because <em class="citetitle">ERIC</em> abstracts virtually all the
                              unpublished materials submitted, <em class="citetitle">RIE</em> includes
                              far too many substandard papers, reports, guides, and the like. Many
                              documents (but not journal articles) can be downloaded as PDF files
                              from the <em class="citetitle">ERIC</em> database; in addition, several
                              libraries maintain a collection of all <em class="citetitle">ERIC</em>
