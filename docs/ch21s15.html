                        volume, each utilizes a combination of length, audience, and country of
                        origin. Assignment to a volume is based on release date (or, lacking that
                        information, date of copyright, initial showing, or licensing by a state
                        commission). Within a volume, films are listed alphabetically by original
                        title (with cross-references to alternative and variant titles). A typical
                        entry consists of four parts, with the components of each depending on the
                        period and kind of film: identification and physical description (citing

                        roles); and description of contents (including genre, source, lengthy
                        synopsis, and subject indexing terms). Notes explain any conflicts in
                        sources. Because many films are not extant or available for screening and

                        physical objects, cinematic devices, animals, and literary works enacted).
                        Volumes A, F1, F3, and F4 have seven to eleven indexes: chronological list

                        literary and dramatic sources. Inevitably there are errors, but the
                        thoroughness of coverage, assimilation of widely scattered factual
                        information, detailed synopses, and excellent indexes make the published

                        between 1888 and 1994. Gifford includes both feature length and short films
                        but excludes amateur productions, films made for and shown exclusively on
                        television, and animations. The 28,158 films are listed chronologically by
                        month of initial exhibition. Depending on the information available, entries
                        include original title (and title changes), length, censor’s rating, sound,
                        color system, screen ratio, production company, distributor, reissues (with
                        date and any title changes), producer, director, author and source of story,
                        author and source of screenplay, narrator, important members of the cast
                        (with roles), type of film (see 1: xiii–xiv for an explanation of
                        categories), a synopsis, and awards. Entries after 1970 identify additional
                        technical and artistic personnel. Indexed by titles in each volume.
                        According to Bottomore, “A Critical View of Some Major Libraries” (<a class="link" href="ch21s15.html#U5741a">U5741a</a>), the Cataloguing

                        releases, and films covered in vol. 2), Gifford is a monumental accumulation
                        of information, but one whose value is considerably diminished by the lack
                        of subject and person indexes. Much fuller information on many films listed

                        fan magazines and technical journals. Expanded coverage of television begins
                        in vol. 5 (1977), of video in vol. 14 (1986). Since vol. 14, entries are
                        organized in two parts: film; television and video. Each part consists of a
                        single author and subject index, with liberal cross-references and with
                        subject headings including titles of films or television programs, persons,
                        geographic areas, and corporate bodies. With its inclusion of television and
                        broader coverage of periodicals that print only occasional material on film
                        or television, this is an important complement to <em class="citetitle">International

                        several hundred films, and several thousand citations to other books and

                        film (with a section on film criticism and theory); genres; stereotyping in
                        film (with sections on feminist approaches to film, psychoanalysis and film,
                        and Jews and African Americans in American films); thematic approaches;

                        Chapters and subdivisions are introduced by extensive commentary. Seven

                        continual use of the indexes. Although omitting several important reference
