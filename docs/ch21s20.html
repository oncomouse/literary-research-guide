                           languages and lesser known Indo-European languages, including endangered

                           North America.” Entries are organized alphabetically by author in
                           classified divisions for general works (including bibliographies),
                           general linguistics, and major language families or areas. The General
                           Linguistics division and individual languages with sufficient scholarship
                           now have sections for bibliographies and general studies, phonetics and
                           phonology, grammar, lexis, semantics and pragmatics, stylistics, metrics

                           appear first, followed by other studies in alphabetical order. Indexed by
                           scholars (including reviewers since the volume for 1993) and by languages
                           and subjects since the volume for 2004. Cross-referencing has improved in
                           recent volumes, but the lack of subject indexing in early volumes hinders
                           access to many works, especially those treating more than one concept,

                           refined. Since vol. 11 (1977) entries are listed alphabetically by author
                           in 27 classified divisions: psycholinguistics, applied linguistics,
                           phonology, syntax, semantics, morphology, discourse analysis and text

                           education. A typical entry in the print version consists of author(s),
                           address of primary author, title and publication information, LC and ISBN
                           numbers for books, and a detailed abstract; the online version adds
                           fields for ISSN, CODEN, language, type of publication, country of
                           publication, descriptors, classification fields, update code, and
                           accession number. Three indexes in each issue: authors; journals and
                           issues indexed; subjects. (The last is a detailed analytic index based on
                           a controlled thesaurus, with each entry providing essentially an abstract
                           of the abstract.) The indexes are cumulated annually; there is also a
                           cumulative index for vols. 1–5 (2 pts.; 1971). The online version is
                           available through ProQuest; see entry <a class="link" href="ch09s02.html#I519" title="I519">I519</a> for an evaluation of the search interface.
                           The multidisciplinary coverage and full subject indexing make

                           dictionaries with a list that refers readers to significant commentary or
                           evaluation in the text. Indexed by persons, titles of anonymous works,
                           and subjects; titles of dictionaries are indexed under editors.
                           Emphasizing practice rather than theory and combining illustration with
                           sometimes trenchant (but fair) evaluation,

                           glossaries, concordances, and syllabaries. Although the majority of the
                           619 bibliographies date from 1658–1988, some works published as late as
                           1990 are included. The entries (organized alphabetically by author,
                           editor, or title of anonymous work) consist of a citation and locations
                           of copies—principally in German libraries—or source of information,

                           items in and types, content, and time periods of dictionaries covered.
                           Several entries conclude with helpful evaluative or historical notes

                           types of bibliographies, and persons. Nearly one-third of the entries
                           were not seen by the author, several works included (e.g., general guides
                           to reference books, journals that merely review dictionaries, and

                              similar works. Since the entries, organized by LC classification, are
                              derived from Library of Congress cataloging records prepared between
                              1966 and the end of 1986, the two volumes potentially include any
                              “word-related” book published or reprinted during that period as well
                              as numerous pre-1966 publications for which LC cards or MARC and
                              REMARC records were prepared. The uncritical reliance on Library of
                              Congress cataloging records leads to considerable duplication of
                              entries (especially of unrevised reprints), serious gaps in coverage
                              (especially of books published before 1966), the inclusion of many
                              works that are only remotely “word-related,” and inconsistencies in
                              the classification of works. The fourth edition improves upon its
                              predecessors by printing a title and subject index, but users will
                              find it less than helpful because of the citation of LC
                              classifications rather than page numbers and the reproduction of
                              frequently imprecise LC subject headings from MARC records. Although
                              seriously flawed and incomplete, Brewer is the most extensive single
                              list of “word-related books.” What would be welcome is a thorough,
                              carefully organized, effectively indexed annotated bibliography based

                           of the interface. Although lacking any explanation of editorial
                           procedures and depending too much on other sources rather than firsthand
                           examination of documents, <em class="citetitle">MetBib</em> offers the most
                           current guide to studies of metaphor. The print volumes are organized
                           alphabetically by author (then by title in Shibles, by date in Noppen,
                           Knop, and Jongen and in Noppen and Hols), with some entries accompanied
                           by descriptive annotations: in Shibles, the annotations vary considerably
                           in quality, and most foreign language works are not annotated; Noppen,
                           Knop, and Jongen and Noppen and Hols offer few annotations, but they tend
                           to be fuller. Both appear to take many entries unverified from other
                           sources. Noppen, Knop, and Jongen concludes with a list of recommended
                           works for beginners. Shibles has three indexes: extensive works on
                           metaphor; general subjects; aspects of metaphor. However, the indexing is
                           uncontrolled, inconsistent, and imprecise. Noppen, Knop, and Jongen also
                           has three indexes: general subjects; uses and theory of metaphor; tenors,
                           vehicles, and their semantic fields (which is useful for locating studies
                           of types of imagery or specific images); Noppen and Hols replaces the
                           general subject index with indexes of disciplines and persons. Although
                           Noppen, Knop, and Jongen’s and Noppen and Hol’s indexing is superior, the
                           combination of entry number and date Noppen, Knop, and Jongen is
                           extremely confusing, and the additions (pp. 486–97 in Noppen, Knop, and
                           Jongen; pp. 345–50 in Noppen and Hols) are excluded. Noppen and Hols is
                           inconsistent in citing reviews: some appear only in a list following the
                           book reviewed, some appear in a list of reviews and have separate entries
                           as well, and some have separate entries but are not cross-referenced to
                           the book reviewed. Both Shibles and Noppen, Knop, and Jorgen suffer from
                           an inadequate statement of scope and coverage. Although they are plagued
                           by errors, inconsistent in annotations, include much that seems only
                           vaguely related to metaphor, omit significant works, and are inadequately
                           indexed in the case of Shibles, the three volumes together encompass an
                           impressive range of international scholarship. For additions to Shibles,

                           number of studies of literary works, locating these studies is frequently
                           impossible except in <em class="citetitle">Semiotik-Bibliographie</em>;

                           nothing more than an uncritical alphabetic list of title keywords (with

                           three compilations, the heavy reliance on other bibliographies leads to
                           the inclusion of numerous works only remotely related to semiotics. The
                           lack of any stated criteria governing what constitutes semiotic
                           scholarship results in a hodgepodge that would benefit from judicious

                           Since the bibliography for 1979 (vol. 15 [1981]), entries are listed
                           alphabetically by author in six divisions: bibliographies; general
                           theory; culture, history, and style—period, nation, and genre; the
                           author; the text; and the reader. The last four have subdivisions for
                           theoretical and applied studies, with the latter classified by elements
                           of style. Three indexes: scholars (beginning with the bibliography for
                           1987–88, in vol. 23 [1989]); subject terms (since the bibliography for
                           1980, in vol. 16 [1982]); persons as subjects (since that for 1981, in
                           vol. 17 [1983]). Although not comprehensive (especially since the
                           bibliography for 1987–88 [vol. 23 (1989)], when coverage was drastically
                           scaled back), the bibliography was once the best source for identifying
                           stylistic scholarship published between 1967 and 1986. Beginning in 26
                           (1992) “Stylistics Annotated Bibliography” was replaced with a
                           bibliography issue that prints checklists and annotated bibliographies of
                           individuals and subjects; the last of these issues appeared in vol. 34

                           bibliographies, language and style before 1900 (with each period

                           creativity and style, modes of stylistic investigation, statistical
                           approaches, translation, prose stylistics, and poetry). A few entries are

                           authors as subjects; scholars. The rather confusing organization, the
                           lack of cross-references, and the failure to provide a subject index
                           seriously impede locating studies on topics, stylistic features, or
                           methodologies. Despite these drawbacks and the incomplete coverage,
                           Bailey and Burton is useful because it represents the fullest list of
                           stylistic studies before 1966 of English and American literature. Review:

                           The approximately 1,500 entries are organized by publication date in six
                           classified divisions: bibliographies and reference works (with sections

                           diction, imagery, and tropes; syntax and schemes; prosody and sound

                           single-author studies (with the same sections as the preceding division);
                           studies of individual texts (again, with the same sections as the
                           preceding division); and the phenomenology of readers (with sections for
                           theoretical and practical studies). A majority of the entries are
                           descriptively annotated (although the annotations too often rely on
                           quotations from the works) and accompanied by citations to reviews (with
                           frequent quotations from reviews). Three appendixes: a chronology of
                           important works and events in stylistics from 1878 to early 1985; a
                           classification of critics by theoretical or methodological approach; a
                           suggested reading list on aspects of stylistic criticism. Four indexes:
                           terms; literary authors and anonymous works; critics and theorists;
                           authors of works cited. Although Bennett is limited by its exclusion of
                           articles and dissertations, unevenly and incompletely annotated
                           (especially for foreign language works), and incomplete in its coverage
                           of studies of individual authors and works, its international coverage

                        language, of syntactic constructions with a verb form as a nucleus.
                        Organized according to the number of verbs in a phrase, then by syntactic
                        unit, the detailed analysis and history of each structural pattern is
                        accompanied by numerous illustrations from Old English to the present
                        century. Indexed by word in vols. 1 and 2, with a cumulative index in 4. The
                        organization is confusing at times, and there are numerous typographical
                        errors. Although reviewers have disagreed with some interpretations, all
                        admit that this is a monumental contribution to the study of English syntax.
                        Literary researchers will find it particularly useful in interpreting
                        syntactic structures in literary works. Reviews: Norman Davis,

                        several countries on English morphology and syntax since c. 1500.
                        Pedagogical studies and popular journalism are excluded. Vols. 1–4 are
                        organized by country, then by type of publication (journal articles, books,
                        dissertations), then alphabetically by author; vol. 5 is organized by
                        periodical, with articles following in order of publication. The individual
                        volumes vary considerably in the thoroughness of their coverage. Some
                        entries in vols. 1–4 are accompanied by descriptive annotations; vol. 5
                        offers extensive descriptions of each article. Vol. 4 prints additions to
                        vols. 1 and 2. Two indexes (scholars and subjects) in each volume; the
                        appendixes and the five countries in vol. 3 are separately indexed, and vol.
                        5 has an additional index of literary authors and works referred to. Vols.
                        1–3 are cumulatively indexed in five indexes in vol. 4: scholars; authors
                        discussed; dissertations (by country, then institution); subjects of
                        articles and books; subjects of dissertations. Although the

                        extensive (but not complete) coverage of foreign language scholarship and
                        inclusion of several studies of literary works, the lack of effective
                        organization and insufficiently thorough indexing make locating works
                        sometimes difficult.</p></section></section></section></section></section><footer><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table style="width: 100%; "><tr><td style="width: 40%; text-align: left; "><a accesskey="p" href="ch21s19.html">Prev</a> </td><td style="width: 20%; text-align: center; "><a accesskey="u" href="ch21.html">Up</a></td><td style="width: 40%; text-align: right; "> <a accesskey="n" href="ch21s21.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 40%; text-align: left; vertical-align: top; ">Interdisciplinary and Multidisciplinary Studies </td><td style="width: 20%; text-align: center; "><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td style="width: 40%; text-align: right; vertical-align: top; "> Literary Criticism and Theory</td></tr></table></div></footer></body></html>
