                     excursions into aesthetics, literary history, and practical criticism.
                     Initially restricted to England, Scotland, France, Germany, and Italy, coverage
                     expands to the United States and Russia in vol. 3. Volumes are organized around
                     chapters devoted to major critics, groups, movements, or countries, with each
                     chapter providing summaries of works and theories along with considerations of
                     their place in Western critical thought. Vols. 1–6 and 8 conclude with a
                     chronology, by country, of critical works. Two indexes in vols. 1–6: persons;
                     topics and terms; vol. 7 is indexed by persons. Although some reviewers have
                     objected to Wellek’s definition of criticism, most agree that this is a
                     masterful, balanced, indispensable exposition of modern critical thought.

                        theory that emphasizes literature but also includes media and cultural
                        studies. Chapter topics randomly appear and disappear without explanation.
                        Those showing up with some consistency include psychoanalysis, feminism(s),
                        colonial discourse and postcolonial theory, film theory, Continental

                        Marxism and post-Marxism. Those that appear less consistently include
                        semiotics, historicism, queer theories and culture, deconstruction, theories

                        randomly, there is little attempt to offer any continuity of coverage. The

                        chapters as they are copyedited and typeset. The surveys vary in quality and
                        extent of coverage and a print volume now appears about a year after its

                        (published through 1992) important to the understanding of critical theory
                        and major theorists since c. 1965. Although emphasizing contemporary theory
                        in the United States, Marshall also includes works by important foreign
                        theorists and about earlier theory. Following a section on general studies
                        (including reference works and journals), entries are organized by schools
                        or approaches: Russian formalism and Prague structuralism; new criticism;
                        structuralism and semiotics; poststructuralism and deconstruction;
                        hermeneutics and phenomenology; reader-response theory; psychological and
                        psychoanalytic critical theory; cultural criticism; Marxist critical theory;
                        poststructuralist cultural criticism; literacy, orality, and printing; myth,
                        anthropology, and critical theory; ethnic and postcolonial criticism; and
                        feminist and gender criticism. Each division or subdivision has up to four
                        parts: bibliographies; introductory works; general books and collections;
                        works by and about major theorists of the field. A headnote briefly surveys
                        the development and major figures of each school or movement, or—for
                        theorists—summarizes his or her leading ideas and career. Some entries are
                        briefly annotated with notes on content and an occasional evaluative
                        comment; most, however, are too terse to offer an adequate sense of the
                        substance or importance of a work. Indexed by persons. Although some works
                        have not been examined by Marshall (and although series titles are omitted
                        in citations), <em class="citetitle">Contemporary Critical Theory</em> will
                        provide a convenient guide to those unfamiliar with the cross-currents of

                        with a few major studies through August 1988. The majority of these works
                        are discussions of theory, although “representative” examples of applied
                        studies are included. The approximately 5,500 unannotated entries are listed
                        alphabetically by author in 12 divisions: structuralism; semiotics
                        (excluding narrative semiotics); narratology, narrative text-grammar, and

                        authors. Although the volume claims “near comprehensive” coverage, there are

                        studies important in the development of Marxist criticism. The unevenly and
                        inconsistently annotated entries are classified in sections for

                        acronyms are identified only in the section listing journals (pp. 6–7). The
                        two indexes are inexplicably restricted to critics “who have at least three

                           positions of key theorists, but some definitions suffer from a lack of
                           clarity (e.g., “desire,” “indeterminacy,” and “margin”) and most would
                           benefit from more attention to how a concept is applied. Indexed by
