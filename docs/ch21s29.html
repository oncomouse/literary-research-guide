                     primarily to the publish-or-perish American academic, chapters explain what
                     publishers do, offer advice on writing (with a valuable excursus on bad

                     submitting a proposal and is, alone, worth the price of this book), reveal what
                     editors look for in a manuscript, advise how to survive the review process
                     (with essential counsel on how to respond to a reader’s report), anatomize

                     essays or an anthology (required reading for any potential editor), outline the

                     with practical advice about how and why one goes about publishing, the essays
                     treat such topics as breaking into print, integrating pedagogy and scholarship,
